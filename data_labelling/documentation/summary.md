# Data Labeling System Diagrams Summary

## Overview

This repository contains a series of diagrams that visualize the structure and function of the data labeling system, with a focus on the Archer prompt optimization component. These diagrams provide multiple perspectives on the system's architecture, data flows, and user interactions.

## Diagrams Included

1. **System Architecture Diagram** (`system_architecture.md`)  
   A high-level view of the system components and their interactions, showing the relationships between the user interface, Archer system, and database.

2. **Directory Structure Diagram** (`directory_structure.md`)  
   A visualization of the codebase organization, detailing the main directories, subdirectories, key files, and their purposes.

3. **Data Flow Diagram** (`data_flow.md`)  
   A diagram tracing how data moves through the system, from input processing to prompt optimization, highlighting the cyclical nature of the process.

4. **User Interaction Flow Diagram** (`user_interaction_flow.md`)  
   A sequence diagram showing the chronological interactions between users and the system, detailing the human-in-the-loop aspect of the data labeling process.

5. **Prompt Optimization Loop Diagram** (`prompt_optimization_loop.md`)  
   A detailed flowchart of the prompt optimization algorithm, showing how prompts are generated, evaluated, and selected in an iterative process.

6. **Comprehensive Explanation** (`diagrams_explanation.md`)  
   A detailed document explaining each diagram, their relationship to the codebase, and why they effectively represent the system.

## Key System Components

The diagrams collectively illustrate these key components:

- **Gradio UI**: The interface users interact with to provide feedback and validation
- **Archer System**: The core optimization engine with two main processes:
  - **Forward Pass**: Generates and evaluates content
  - **Backward Pass**: Optimizes prompts based on evaluations
- **Argilla Database**: Stores all system data, including prompts, generations, and evaluations

## Optimization Loop

The central process depicted is a continuous improvement loop:

1. Generate content using current prompts
2. Evaluate the generated content
3. Collect human validation on evaluations
4. Analyze feedback to identify issues
5. Generate improved prompt candidates
6. Test and score candidate prompts
7. Select best-performing prompts
8. Repeat with new prompts

## How to Use These Diagrams

These diagrams can be used to:

1. Understand the overall architecture of the data labeling system
2. Navigate the codebase structure more efficiently
3. Follow the data flow through the system
4. Comprehend the user interaction process
5. Grasp the algorithmic nature of prompt optimization

By viewing these diagrams together, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of both the structure and function of the data labeling system.
