Can we do a round, just name and position at the school? I can start. I'm Will. I am the CEO of SwiftScore.Um, Lori, could go next. Hi, I'm Lori.

**Lori Riggs**I am the 12th career assistant principal at George Washington High School. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**How about Kamala?

**Kamala Kandi**Oh, hi, I'm Kamala, and I am the 10th career assistant principal at George Washington High School. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Um, Melissa, are you there?

**Kamala Kandi**We can come back to her.

**Will Krasnow**then Antonio's.

**Antonios Pitsakis**Hi, I'm Tony, but I guess I'm the 11th grade assistant principal at George Washington High School. Okay, sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Cool. Well, it's nice to meet y'all. Before jumping in, how familiar.

**Kamala Kandi**you know with the program that I like with Swift score and what what we do I can start from scratch or if you kind of cut you guys up now we're sorry I'm sorry from scratch I am caught up because I use your tool okay nice sorry makes my life so you think I'm in the middle how is it gonna come on it's really a wonderful and it's part on I like the way the AI things and I like even the coaching points you bring out at the end so it's pretty beneficial that's what I was mentioning to my colleagues here I've been amazing amazing when when was that was that in January was that just a couple weeks back nosometime in the January because I've done all my evaluations on that we used to use under AI before and that crashed or something happened sorry something went wrong with that AI and then we were introduced to this new one and I do take my notes and time but the teacher's name number of students objective time and then I do the activity teacher action student action so I do it in a great format and good pieces I just copy the entire thing all the pictures everything I copy and paste it I don't know if it looks at the pictures at all I don't think it does it so you look at the pictures it's if you copied and paste the pictures it probably won't yet but we're building it out so it will right so it does take in all my notes and if I getUnreasonable evaluation. go back to my notes and check what is missing. It does look for key words. So brings out the evaluation for all the components.Just kind of, no, not 10. 8 components. Right, right.

**Will Krasnow**then we do the first domain ourselves.

**Kamala Kandi**Okay. Love it. Incredible.

**Will Krasnow**Question for y'all. Are you doing that, I assume at home or on a hotspot? Or, you're able, is it unblocked at the school?Yeah, I can't remember.

**Kamala Kandi**Most of it is at home, I think.

**Melissa Green**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**We're going through the process of having it like just because most links are are blocked on the Wi-Fi. So you might have to do a hotspot.So I'm curious how about it. Actually, you know what? I could try it right now while you are feeling for the rest of the people.

**Kamala Kandi**Okay, cool.

**Will Krasnow**While you're trying- Is different than PlayLab or is this the same thing?

**Lori Riggs**This is similar, but different.

**Will Krasnow**I'm not familiar with this one then. Okay, sweet, you've used the PlayLab.

**Lori Riggs**Yes.

**Will Krasnow**amazing. yeah, so we're the players of that PlayLab tool that you're using, that I'm sure is that PlayLab Danish and generator.Essentially what we did is we took that PlayLab and then we created like in a secure private environment, a more robust tool.So you upload your notes, you then can see a score and evaluation, adjust it within our system and then we'll store so you can track teacher growth over it.

**Lori Riggs**Oh, Yeah, just tried your link and it is blocked. It is blocked, okay.

**Will Krasnow**So what I'm gonna do here today then is I will just show you guys how it works on my computer.and then send you the link in like a tutorial and all of that stuff so you can use it.You can either do some people prefer, they're like, I'm going to do it at school, so they'll just use a hotspot.And then again, within a couple weeks, it's very likely you won't have to do the hotspot. And then, or you could just, you could do it at home.Sweet. Hey, Melissa, how's going?

**Melissa Green**Thanks for hopping on.

**Will Krasnow**I hope it's too busy. Okay, so sweet. I will just demo the tool. a second. Yeah.

**Kamala Kandi**Isn't this the same thing? PlayLab.ai?

**Will Krasnow**Oh, so this is, so you've been using the PlayLab. So we are the makers of the PlayLab. But we are using, we have developed a more robot.version that we've been rolling out to so far about 20 principles and their assistant principles across Philadelphia. So I kept back up just a little bit.We made the Play Lab a little over a year ago and obviously that has been helpful for creating evaluations and then what we did in the past six months is we've worked pretty closely with principles that infinitely to create like I was saying to Laurie like a secure environment, a separate environment and then one that makes it a little bit easier to edit the information and then store it for growth over time.So this one Sue has been using for a couple months now and it's her track teacher growth and then have a little bit more precision.So What I can do here today is just show y'all the tool. I'll send you information afterwards so like how you can use it.But I hope it should be pretty easy to understand, but y'all can leave as experts of it. So this is EVAL by SWIFT score.com.So I'm just going to send you a link and you could go to this again hotspot or it could be at home.And all you have to do is enter a teacher's name and then enter some notes. So I'm going to pull up.Does anyone actually have no inference notes, handy that they wanted to create into an evaluation? I'm going to pull up a sample that I have myself.Okay, so I will drop here. low inference notes. This is right obviously like student, teacher, it can be in a bunch of different formats and you click generate report and what our tool is going to do is going to create a dangerous and evaluation for that teacher.All of it is going to be editable and it's completely compatible with district privacy security. From there you're going to be able to click into each specific component and see more robust feedback.So here's an example. This teacher got a 1.8 out of 4. You'll see all of the different components here and you can click into one and change the score if you see fit.Now if there's specific component you are particularly interested in seeing, you can click 2D. You'll see your low inference notes in the side.including on the left of long form analysis, right? So this will be similar to what you've seen in PlayLab.It starts at the performance analysis, happened, and then a growth path. This is what the teacher could do to improve.One of the things we built out since PlayLab is you can generate a teacher-specific summary, which will allow you to generate this smaller, shorter form summary of what happened, designed to send directly to a teacher, or this is what we'd recommend you put into power school.Now you can copy this and put this in your data management system, go on to a different component, any of the components and procedures in there.If you have any specific questions, you can still talk to a chatbot, just like you could in PlayLab. And then you could go home and see your teacher, the average of all of their evaluations and map their growth over time.So from there, you can then even create a specific coaching plan. So before actually going on and starting this coaching plan, I'm going stop.Are there any questions about how that worked? Is this the average of all formal and informal evaluation questions?

**Kamala Kandi**is it formal?

**Will Krasnow**Great question. It will be both. Well, whatever you input into Swift score, it will show. Most of our users choose to do it both for informal and formal.So show up. Yeah, good question.

**Kamala Kandi**So obviously it can't do the domain four, right? Yes.

**Will Krasnow**E, domain force is blocked out here. Now, if you wanna change the score and you have something you can edit that, and then you can go in and type your own suggestions for domain force.I have a question.

**Antonios Pitsakis**So we have, for our ELA teachers, we have a evaluation matrix that we're given to evaluate how they're using for what's evidence or whatever for these metrics, for studies think, which is the program that we're supposed to be using.Is there a way to plug that in there, and then have that give feedback, don't know, metric O, metric T, or something, within the feedback or is it just straight?Right here. Daniel's on.

**Will Krasnow**So, is this a framework that's different than Daniel's on, or it works alongside?

**Antonios Pitsakis**It's basically for, it was created to help teachers, help us evaluate teachers usage of study sync, but in collaboration with Daniels, and there's four domains, but it's not Daniels and Domains, they're just, I mean, I can share it with you, you like.

**Will Krasnow**It to this component of Daniels, and now, it's just, it's a walk.

**Antonios Pitsakis**Is that what you're mentioning, they're not only the walk-to checklist? Yeah.

**Kamala Kandi**So there are four domains, reading, writing, speaking, listening, those four, whatever order, and they have checklist is the teacher doing this, is the teacher doing this, is the teacher doing this.So, this is checklist for observer to go through when they step into the classroom. Yeah, it doesn't align itself with the Danielson evaluation at all completely, but I don't know how that can be used with this tool.Right.

**Will Krasnow**so one of the things, yeah, if you share that with me, we could, one of the things that we're doing, building it out to be compatible with other frameworks than Danielson.So this is one we could put on the list. Oh, this is the walkthrough. Yeah.

**Antonios Pitsakis**Got you.

**Will Krasnow**So they do include, oh, oh, oh, yes, so this is actually, we are working towards this in a slightly different way.So this is before each teacher specifically. But what we're building out here is if you have all of your teachers within SwiftSpore, right?So you have Will here and then you had another teacher and another teacher. You could generate. There would be a button right around here, you know, that.would say generate trend report and what that will do is pull data from each of the different teachers and then suggest summary relative to this framework you sent me to get a picture of what your whole school is looking like and what could use work or what is strong.Again just like the other you know evaluations that it's going to be right about 80% of the time and then 20% you're going to have to edit it and make sure it's good but yeah we're building it out so that not for a specific teacher but actually for the school as a whole you could have announced this based on that.Cool, any other questions? Amazing. So from here you can click and aim to create a coaching report or you can click into the specific teacher.And you can see a graph of how they're doing over time and then define a coaching focus. So this is going to take the different domains and I can click on that domain and then sub down a different specific component in order to create a bite sized coaching plan.So since creating the Play Lab, one of the things that we heard a lot was, okay, this is nice, but it's a lot of words, right?And at the end of the day, one of the things that we want is just like a couple of specific things for the teacher to work on and the way to track that over time.So what you could do from here is you click on say Domain 1A for Danielson and then we're going to suggest a couple of sub components.So we could do strategic planning for differentiated instruction and then one more implementation strategy of that component so that we can join.a very specific coaching plan. So let's do incorporate varied instructional strategies. From there, you will generate a specific coaching report that looks like this.So we'll give a general overview, have a date, and it will identify this is the specific focus we are working towards, and created varied instructional strategies.Now, it will then have three core action steps, Implement Think, Think, introduce visual aids, and differentiated measurement tasks. Now this is an eight-week timeline, so say over the next six to eight weeks, and it has a recommendation for each of these next steps.So this is a four weeks for Think, Think, Share, it includes a SMART goal, then specific examples about what that would look like.This is for six weeks, and then this is for eight weeks. And then within that, you can track how your teacher has been progressing by either adjusting this here and actually just clicking and saying they've grown this much.Or you can upload new evaluations in the system and we will automatically find changes and update the teacher progress towards this coaching plan.So this is our way to help you assist in the long time it takes to create a coaching plan.But then simultaneously track how your teacher is doing over time. Now once they've reached progress for all of the three action steps or you're ready and you could just mark it as completed you can start a new coaching focus.But until then you can go home and actually see your teacher and see how they're doing. This is one data point but this would normally be a graph of third multiple.evaluations relative to one A over time. When you're done, you can create new evaluation, drop some low inference notes, and start again.Any questions about that? Sweet. Now, of course, Susie's using the tool and finds value in it, but y'all are different with different scenarios, right?How does it seem to you, you know, is this something that you're interested in using? I'm completely honest, answers are good.I am interested in using it.

**Kamala Kandi**I am a little... I still have to process the tool because the one I was using was PlayLab. Yeah.And it worked pretty and decent for me, but this new one has got updated features of tracking the growth of the teacher over time and creating a coaching plan which is kind of decent.Yeah I still have to flare on with the tools. I saw when you did the coaching plan there were five levels the teacher could improve one through five.Is that true? That's correct. That's from the genius and metrics.

**Will Krasnow**That's correct.

**Kamala Kandi**It's different. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

**Lori Riggs**think I need to play with a little bit like in real time with real data, you know, something new.Got to learn something new again.

**Will Krasnow**Yes.

**Lori Riggs**Everything's always changing so quickly, so I just got to have to play with it.

**Kamala Kandi**Of course. does it work for you?

**Lori Riggs**Yes, I mean, same thing with Tony, like I have a walk-through guide also, so I just have to modify a little bit.

**Kamala Kandi**Yeah, I would be in the same boat next year because science is getting the new curriculum as well. I'm sure they'll create a walk-through checklist for science curriculum as well, so let's put a thought for you, Will.Yeah, yeah, yeah, to drill into more specifics.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. Oh, thanks. Cool, cool. Well, look, I apologize for adding another thing to the learner. I do understand that y'all are incredibly busy.I will try and make this as easy as possible, so what is it's a tutorial, so what that is is it just clicks you through.each step. And we'll show you what you can do and what happens because you're right. There are like a lot of different things that happened.So you can do that. And then I'm even going to draw my phone number. So you can just send me an email or you can literally just send me a text questions anytime.And then what I'll probably do with Sue as well as we'll find a time sometime in the future for me to actually come by the school because of the rescheduling I wasn't able to come this time.But then I can, especially once it's off the blocking of the district, Wi-Fi and everything, come in and assist in any way that I can.But again, I appreciate the time. we found is generally with our users that it takes about like 15 minutes of like focused let me learn the tool time.then afterwards it's pretty easy. So let me know if that is experience or there is any way that I can assist you.Thank you.

**Kamala Kandi**Thank you.

**Lori Riggs**Of course have a great day and I'll send you guys those to follow up. Thanks so much. Have a good you

Um, you know, and a challenging time at school, but, um, at the same time, I'm grateful to be in a school because it's like where we can do some work and not feel helpful, you know?

**Will Krasnow**This is true, this is true. Um, do you, do you have any, like, work to do with, like, separation, with, like, ice, uh, is that?Yeah, yeah.

**Lauren Overton**So we did a training with our staff because, I don't know if you like, we're following, but our school district, um, has kind of changed our policy from last year, or from the previous time that Trump was in office, we had a sanctuary school's policy where he wasn't even permitted in the building.Right. it's permitted in the building, but they have to sit in office and tell, you know, and so that freaked people out, because that's a show when it seems like a weakening of, like, what's happening.But then they have to go through me, and then I have to go through general counsel, the likely. of that happening at a K to eight is very minimal because more my friends in high schools are worried about that because it's like yeah we would be coming for a kid that has a warrant for their arrest basically not necessarily for a little kid but we have had folks like my friend who's the principal at Kirkbright had a parent get detained in 2020 outside on the schoolyard in front of kids so like they're largely coming for adults however I think it makes it feel uneasy so yeah we went through the training for that basically like my staff can't make any decisions about that so a nice agent shows up at school they're supposed to just sit in office until they can speak with me or another member of the leadership team and then um but yeah and also just like around here on university city I don't know if you follow but a lot of the folks that are like um you know organizers there's like these appsthat show like where people have encountered ice and a lot of that's happened like you know the university people don't realize there's actually an ice office like just a few blocks from our school and during like normal times you wouldn't even realize that that exists but because we're like hyper alerted to it at the moment it's freaking some families out although i'm grateful like my families are still sending their kids here because i stood in front of them and okay i took out personal liability insurance i'm not letting them take a child i know that most to say but you know but other schools like kids are straight up not coming to school wow wow that's crazy my neighbor is the counselor for the cyber charter she said every week they're getting like a hundred new kids and they're all mostly kids of like um families that are immigrant who are scared to go to the actual physical school right that's ridiculous yeah yeah so crazy times but i am great allCome up with a time saver because in the midst of all this emotional Starm and dron that sounds kind of nice to do something Some of them not miss stuff off my plate.That's the goal.

**Will Krasnow**That's the goal.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah Can I tell you I've been doing recently, which is like kind of like my live version of what I think you're doing Please.Yeah I last year I was getting my dissertation. So I I was finishing my dissertation. So I had Like the souped up version of otter ai Cool.So I was using otter ai and even though I'm not really supposed to per union But like I'm only recording it to record notes.So I hit record. It records what happens in the classroom nice It's out of summaries and then I was running it through google gemini.Yeah Asking per danielson like what next steps would you take cool? So that's my like diy version what I would say that I don't love Is that otter ai doesn't pick up the sound of allvoices in the classroom. So like oftentimes you can hear like a teacher and then it sort of becomes like the notes become kind of wonky and especially if like a quiet kid talks, you can't hear it.So that's what I've been doing. Got you, got you.

**Will Krasnow**You doing that for all of your classes, all of your observations?

**Lauren Overton**I'm doing it for some of them, especially ones that I'm in the classroom for more than 47 minutes because it's dual purpose.It's also that I have ADHD and I like to like pay attention to what the kids are doing in the classroom.And so then sometimes I fail at being able to take the low inference notes that I want to take because I'm asking kids questions or you know, freeze me up to be like more actively engaged in the classroom so that I can then go back and it records the recording so I can listen to the audio again if it's like if it's a formal observation.And and it makes me like a summary set of notes so that I can go back and see, you know, what big sort of themes came out from the conversation.Got you, got you.

**Will Krasnow**So how is the feedback you're getting from Gemini? How good is that?

**Lauren Overton**It's not great.

**Will Krasnow**It's so, so, like, you know, and it's like pretty generic too. Got you. And then I assume that's for, like, you're gonna, you'll take that, you'll edit that and you put that into power school or something.power schools, sometimes I send people a follow-up email, sometimes I do a-up person.

**Lauren Overton**If it's somebody that I know is also working with, like, one of my school-based teacher leaders, then it would be like an informal conversation I'd have with them about, like, hey, I noticed this is, and in the classroom, can you work on this with them, like, during your coaching sessions over the next couple weeks?How many SVTLs do you have one so I did have two, but I switched the structure I have one SVTL two intervention folks so Yeah, because I just needed to give some more one-to-one time to some kids that were struggling And also we have a structure where like my assistant principal myself.I have a principal resident and SVTL So we like share the load a little bit. Yeah Do there's the AP and what was the other and principal in Resident yeah, they both actually do this support as well.So the AP is gonna come to today's session But we had an incident with a teacher so she needed to go sit in the classroom and my principal resident is actually at the Oh my gosh, what's it called It's a school conference in L.A.or San Diego this week Schools something like that. So she's there with her like other residents And, but my plan is to share with them like what this looks like as well.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. Amazing. Okay. Final question. then I'll tell you all about what we have and we can write up. For coaching, like putting teachers on like a six-week plan or an eight-week plan, how often are you doing that?Is that something?

**Lauren Overton**We do have a quarter race, so we have, so each quarter of the year, we have a partnership with the University Pennsylvania.So we have a woman named Brittany who comes from UPenn and based on data and based on feedback, I assign her up to six teachers per cycle for mathematics.And then around ELA, it's actually all the other folks on my leadership team.

**Will Krasnow**We all are ELA people.

**Lauren Overton**So we're able to divide up, like, who we're going to coach around ELA issues, and then who for coaching around behavior management or other things or planning.Yeah, so it's at quarterly we do that. So that's every nine to 10 weeks. We're looking at how we can figure out who needs the most support.we do it on an as needed basis. somebody might not get coaching all year, but get informal feedback and thought partnership.But other folks may have formalized coach all year, especially like newer teachers or teachers that just really are struggling to meet the expectations.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, got you. So some have coaching all year, but everyone gets a quarter.

**Lauren Overton**Everyone gets at least a touchpoint once a year, but you switch it up quarterly based on like needs. So we look at student data, we look at our informal formal observations, and then we decide who gets the coaching from there.And then it's content specific as well. Nice.

**Will Krasnow**how, when you look at formal and informal observations, what does that look like? you're just looking at the past ones and kind of just seeing what next steps you said over time.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah. we'll look at the folks that we've looked at for the past like let's say six weeks. We'll look back and we'll play.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Like these teachers need XYZ. This has been a continuous trend.

**Will Krasnow**Sure.

**Lauren Overton**So anecdotally, we'll share like information. We're not allowed to share the actual like observation with the coaches. Right.

**Will Krasnow**give them like bullet points of like what we believe they need to work on. She's a math teacher there.So she's through the RMT.

**Lauren Overton**Well, it was RMT, but they lost funding for it. So it was a responsive math teaching program. Yeah, and she's providing coaching and PLC work at our school, but it's like non-evaluative, which I appreciate and She works with Caroline Ebby at the grad school And then we contracted with her where we essentially bought out One day of her contract So we paid like $20,000 to have her like one day a week basically for the year on these two Very cool.

**Will Krasnow**

> Very cool. Yeah, super cool Okay, thank you for giving me that picture brief free picture about us which some of this might be slightly redundant.
> 

> So I apologize in the past year I found a sort of score met Matt Kelly within that time and We have been talking about exactly the the problem you kind of articulated with us here Which is school leaders like you're so incredibly busy There's million different things going on and then there's this monotonous component of creating about you
> 

> And then on top of that, when it comes to creating coaching focuses and plans for teacher, you're looking at many different portals, you're looking at, you know, steps, you have to align with SVTL priorities and the APN.
> 

> And what we wanted to do was essentially build a single portal that allows you to upload your notes, instantly receive an evaluation that you can edit.
> 

> So it's a first draft, right, but is pretty aligned with your needs, what you would want to say to a teacher, and then have that all stored in this portal so that you can actually analyze trends over time and get better feedback as you grow your teacher.
> 

> And one of the things we also built out is we can actually generate six-week eight-week coaching reports for each teacher, and that will be based on all of the past evaluations you've put in the system as well.
> 

> Again, not designed to be perfect, but definitely designed to be allowed. not stronger than probably what you're seeing from Gemini and easy easy to use that we are been rolling this out to so far about 20 different new Balor Fellows across what else and essentially have been like hey we just want to give it you want to learn how how it's working for you all and what we're likely going to do is an actually big begun to do is is bring in Penn Graduate School of Education and the new Balor Foundation to be like hey let's let's research how this tool is going with these different school leaders across Philadelphia and then in return you know we'll give this tool for free to open them as long as you know every once in a while they're like hey this is going good or it's not or I don't whatever okay so if I'll show you the tool and if it's I'd love to just give you access

ACTION ITEM

**Try SwiftScore tool for teacher evaluations this week**

> We could get your principal in residence, your AP, your SPTO, whatever you want set up as well. Does that sound good?
> 

> Yeah, I would love to try this.
> 

**Lauren Overton**mean, honestly, anything that could make this job more sustainable is awesome. Yeah, so I'm down to give it a try and see how it goes and pilot it.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet. Amazing. So here's my question for you. Is do you have any so we could take otter AI summaries.It's not going to be as good as like low inference notes.

**Lauren Overton**No, I can take them low and for you need like an example of a low inference notes. Yeah, because I could just show you.

**Will Krasnow**If you send me one, I can actually just show you it on the tool right now. Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Cool. me one second. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**All right.

**Lauren Overton**I'll pull up like an old one. So. I typically do three columns, student, teacher, other.

**Will Krasnow**I typically do three columns, student, for one that's like media.

**Lauren Overton**Hang on. Okay. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**All right.

**Lauren Overton**All right. So you just want me to share with you. Yeah, That'd be great. All right. What's your email?

**Will Krasnow**Well, we'll at Swift score.org. Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Well, that's Swift score.org. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Got it.

**Lauren Overton**All right, I just sent it to you. Sweet. There's just like one example of a math lesson, and I was in there a ton of time.That should be totally fine.

**Will Krasnow**Got it. Let me take this pound. OK. And you can, I don't need to keep this at all.

**Lauren Overton**You can do whatever you need to do on the document. OK, nice.

**Will Krasnow**So this would be student on the right teacher on the left. So this should do pretty good. OK. So I'm going to present my screen.I can show you. This is what I'm going to send you, which is ebound. That's what it's for. Essentially, you could just put in the teacher's name.Do have the first initial teacher? Yeah, so L. OK, it was a Mr. L, myself. And literally, could just you could type your notes in here.Okay. Copy and paste them right here and just going to put them all here. We could also just accept a PDF as well and then click generate report.And what we're going to do is generate Danielson scores for each of the relevant components here and have feedback as well.This is all completely on Gemini as well. So, and we are getting the process of Philadelphia School District procurement and all of that stuff.Gotcha. And I'll get this just a second to load here. And one of things we're going to be able to do too is filter.Okay, sweet. The specific component that you're interested in. So you'll get the score. Miss Al got a 2.7. This is out of four.If you don't agree with any of these scores. You could literally just click and change how it goes, and then it'll be stored accordingly.You're gonna get a high level summary down here with a chat box, and you can ask a specific question.Okay. So like what was something she should have done give it in one sentence, right? Something like that, and we'll provide some feedback.I'm not sure what's saying this hit. Oh, cause her name's in there. Oh, I see. That's why I was reading it from the notes.

**Lauren Overton**Understood, understood. well that is super cool. Thanks.

**Will Krasnow**And this is literally, you can ask anything. It's, it's, think of it as Gemini, but you are looking at these low inference notes.Okay.

**Lauren Overton**it's got Danielson programmed in. You said it's four, but it's really four domains out of three, right? This is three.Is the highest or you can get on Daniel said?

**Will Krasnow**For hours? Yes. We will. So the way that we have it is that the lowest you can get on ours is one.I'm going to guess. Here's a zero to three.

**Lauren Overton**Yes. Okay. We're on one to four.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, okay. Okay.

**Lauren Overton**So we just bump it down a number.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Or yes, that's great. Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**So this would be, if the three was the highest, this would be a 1.73. Got it. And then if I wanted to see a specific component, so is there a particular one you're interested in?Like one A, one B and E? Yeah, let's look at the instruction.

**Lauren Overton**Three D. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Three D. So what I'm going to get here is I can see on the left side my love inference notes.So everything that I, you actually typed. you could just see what it's referencing, right? Okay. And then on the left side you're going to get feedback and it's going to come in the form of a performance analysis.So recommendations, I'll let you give you second to read it. Okay. And then a growth path. these are the recommendations for next steps.

**Lauren Overton**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Now, if you were like, I'm going to give this to a teacher, this is a little bit long, you can generate a teacher-specific summary, which is just going to kind of collapse to one paragraph, make it little bit shorter, a little bit more engaging.Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Then you can go up and you can click on any of the other components that you're maybe interested in seeing.You can toggle through. Go to 3C. Okay. Okay. This one gave some more concrete examples here. And all of this is copyable.So you could just copy that, throw that in an email.

**Lauren Overton**Gotcha.

**Will Krasnow**Power school, edit it from there. Cool. And then it's all going to be stored in Swift score. So if I go here, I'm going to see Miss Elle I'm going to see the score that she got.Yep.

**Lauren Overton**The number of valuations in her percent change over time. Gotcha.

**Will Krasnow**Cool.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, that looks awesome.

**Will Krasnow**That's pretty easy going.

**Lauren Overton**think the one thing that I would say is that if there is a way for you to code this so that it was on the same scale as the school district, that would make it really wonderful.also for, hang on, let me see. Have you been able to play in power schools at all? So like see what we are putting in?Yes, I have. Because the one thing, so like professional responsibilities doesn't show up in the informal, but shows up in the formal So I wonder if you like could design formal and informal Template that like what would have a pathway like click here if you're doing an informal click here If you're doing a formal and that it would be aligned to the rubrics that we use for each of those That would probably even make this even more marketable to people at this school district would be my guess Because it's close and like I definitely will use this But I think like if it was even locked step with what we're using it would be great I'm pulling it up right now just so that I can tell you like The and you can stop me if you know this already So for exampleLet's just say I'm actually going to go to an observation later today. So I'm going to go into and I can show you my screen if you want.Do you want me to add it? Yeah, sure.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, stop something for a second. All right. Cool.

**Lauren Overton**One second.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Lauren Overton**let's say I'm going to do an informal for math t-shirt today.

**Will Krasnow**And I'm going to share my screen with you.

**Lauren Overton**Hold tight one second. Again.

**Will Krasnow**There's power school. Reform.

**Lauren Overton**Okay. All right. Cool. So you should be able to see my power school.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, you can see it.

**Lauren Overton**Okay. So when I go in here, right? So I'm going to do one for Mr. Han later. So I'll just do him cool.I'm doing an informal observation and start. Okay. So, for the informal, what I have access to is just this.So, it's classroom environment 2B, 2C, 2D, that's it. Then I have instruction 3A, 3B, 3C, that's it. That's it for the informal.The reason I say that that's helpful is like because then if I'm tracking in formals and formals on your platform, it would be great to have it set up or like directly aligned with what I'm able to actually go see.Because this is quantifying other portions of Danielson that are just used for the formal. Now on the formal, there's a different piece, right?So, I'll go to staff. I'm going to leave. you can score people on. I would adjust it for that.

**Will Krasnow**So just to show you, we actually do have that one now. So I show you this here. So if you go to this park here, and you can toggle between all of the Danielson frameworks.Okay, cool.

**Lauren Overton**And then just fill it up with schools.

**Will Krasnow**So I'm going to guess that are same Yep.

**Lauren Overton**Yep.

**Will Krasnow**those. That being said, we still are on a scale of one to four. So adjusting that's one to three.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, that would be just a little bit easier.

**Will Krasnow**But yes, so this would then be a two. That but that is helpful to see as well. And one of the things that our user are currently doing that I think one of the things that we're working towards is having it automatically shoot into our school.So if you could just integrate it, right? So you create it and it goes. Yeah, for now, what I would recommend is you just go into one C.and for that comment section below, you could pop this in, just copy and paste it there, then edit it as you see it.Got it, okay, cool. and then you do have that score there, but then again, having that on a one, a zero to three is just a little bit easier if that's something we could totally do.Okay, cool. The, okay, but that's very helpful. Does that kind of get at what you're saying? Yes, yes, does.

**Lauren Overton**No, it definitely does.

**Will Krasnow**So that's helpful.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, I'm down to try using today. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Based on this, I'm curious, how does, how did you, we looked at 3D, right? Like how do you find this feedback?Cause one of the things we're always trying to do too is improve it and we have the capacity to do so.Yeah, but I'm curious, how do find it?

**Lauren Overton**So like in this particular case, I don't know that actually her using technology, like it gives an example of using technology, she actually did have up on the screen.pictures of different tops across cultures, kids were sharing about them, some kids talked about Dradol, another kid talked about a Mexican street game that I forgot what the name of the top was, but like, so in this case, that I think is a bit of a myth, like on the bottom of the technology piece, like food enhancer, I don't know that she would have because I actually think it was pretty engaging.And she had some pictures up on the board so that she was utilizing technology, but the kids were also like using what they had in their brain from their own lived experiences.Understood. So I think that, you know, that piece, but. And then, but the big, this one was okay.

**Will Krasnow**Yep. And then what about this growth past year?

**Lauren Overton**Yes, you like, that tells her to use technology, which she does use all the time. So this is where like being a person and like the certain.like I go into her classroom. I know she uses videos. I know she uses images. I know she uses a smart bird all the time.

**Will Krasnow**So that's actually not helpful.

**Lauren Overton**Got you.

**Will Krasnow**Got you. I think this should approach.

**Lauren Overton**Sure. Yeah. Three read strategy.

**Will Krasnow**Sure.

**Lauren Overton**Yes. Yep. The rest is fine. It was just the thing about the incorporating technology doesn't make sense because there were some things that I don't the notes picked up on.Great. It almost would be good if you guys created a template that had like prompting questions that align to what would make for good low inference notes.Yes.

**Will Krasnow**I think that is something we're working on. Can I show you this one other thing that might be helpful as well?Yeah. we were looking oh sorry we're on 3D there. Yeah. But okay. Let's say we go oh that is what we want to do.We can go to this home gauge here.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah. Go in here.

**Will Krasnow**So, this is going to show you, I told you this, the averages, the different teachers, but then you're also going to be able to define a coaching for each of these teachers as well.whether it's a recorder you want to do this, or right after doing an evaluation, we want to do is making coaching much easier.Okay. there's no active coaching report, so you can start your coaching flow. And sometimes, we see our users just use it for just creating evaluations.I just got a message from my brother literally right now, so some of these numbers are going to be off because he's working on it.My brother is a technical guy behind all this, but I think that it still should generate the report. If I click 3C, you can choose the specific coaching focus, you want under 3C, so if you're using technology, you probably wouldn't click this one, right?But maybe there is a different one that you wanted to focus on here. Is there one?

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, I'm with cultural responsive teaching and inclusion. is built in. Let's try that. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**And then it's going to do one more specific. So to your point, right, like you're the instructional leader, you know what to do.And this will help you kind of get guide the AI little bit towards a more effective response.

**Lauren Overton**That's cool. So you get from there to lesson planning. The culture response of lesson planning.

**Will Krasnow**So now what it's going to do is generate a to help this teacher grow with these specific things. Okay.Usually it's a little quick time, so it doesn't wonder if it's stressed one more time. Are you studying at Penn writing?I am, yeah.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, what are you doing?

**Will Krasnow**I'm studying philosophy actually.

**Lauren Overton**I'm graduating in May.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, that's cool. Are you an undergrad or grad school? undergrad. I've been mostly in the GSE here, just taking like a cool philosophy of education course, like history of education course.yeah, I am very excited to graduate though. I'll be staying in Philly.

**Lauren Overton**was say, you should check out the Ed Entrepreneurial Program with Caroline Hill, who's like one of my folks that coaches me, because I feel like this would be like right up her alley.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'm sure, you know, I should talk to this. We're pretty ingrained with catalysts at PEN GSE.

**Lauren Overton**With Michael. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Will Krasnow**So I'm super interested in, yeah, I was like, I think the coaching thing that you have a partnership with PEN seems pretty cool.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, well, if you ever need anybody like after I use this at a time, until I talk to the program, let me know.Okay, cool.

**Will Krasnow**Thanks. So I do apologize. I'm not sure exactly what's happening here. No, you see he's on the other end So it might be he is on the other end, but I thought he thought it would still work But I'll have to clear this up, but it will be done.I'm sure within like the hour at the very latest But I know that's exciting. Do you want to send me logon information and I'll get like 1000% yeah, I just want to show you the final things anyways if you click these things, right?would generate a report Okay, I can show you what that report would look like as well just like in our designs And then like essentially it's gonna create a six-week coaching plan for that teacher based on the that with three action steps So if I go here, I'm going to present my screen on a different tabIt essentially looks like this, where you would have, you know, access of one, access of two, access of three, and each is company with like a smartphone, a description, and examples of what you can do to intervene.And all this is editable. And what you'll notice as well is that based on these evaluations that the upcoming evaluations, it will mark the teacher's progress towards those action steps.if you create this coaching process and then you upload a couple informals, you'll see, oh snap, they achieved the first action steps.Now we just want to start talking about the next week.

**Lauren Overton**Cool. I Well, this is really great, really smart. Yeah, very cool. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**And then the final, final thing, and then I want to stop talking and give you access to it, is if you click on a teacher's description.of the card, you're going to see it here. is the back end thing, so I guess I can get into that.But I'll explain it. If you see a teacher's card, you're going to see an average page with changes over time of the evaluation score, or if you defined 3D as your system coaching focus, you could visualize that as well, and how that changes across the different forms.But yeah, so that is the gist. I can totally, you want me to give you access and everything and get you set up, right?

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, that would be great.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Yeah, we'll definitely play with it.

**Lauren Overton**yeah, let me know when you need feedback, but I will start playing with it this week. Okay, amazing.

**Will Krasnow**So what I'm going to do is after this call, going to send you a link. Or actually, you know what?Can we do it now? I can just let this be easier because rather than having questions. So can you go to this?And this is going to be a, it's going to look slightly different because this is, we're coming out with, like, all these updates tomorrow, which, again, why my brother is on the back end right now.Sorry, I just presented our action screen. Okay. Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Wait, and that's not it either. Hold up. Stop sharing some presenting.

**Will Krasnow**And copy.

**Lauren Overton**Okay. Oh, it says morning.

**Will Krasnow**It says that I can't get into it.

**Lauren Overton**Right.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. on district Wi-Fi, what our users are doing is either using a hotspot or doing it out because we're going through the procurement process right now.And so anything that's not approved by Philly SD is. a is just blocked. But what I rather than having you do a hotspot or anything like now, which I'm considering, I will send you a follow up.

**Lauren Overton**Yes, then you'll follow up because I will do it when I'm at home tomorrow. Okay, see what I can do.And then, yeah, that'll be good. Okay. Okay, amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Nice.

**Lauren Overton**And I will also set up my AP and my resident if you want to send me or if you just want their information, let me know.

ACTION ITEM

**Send login info & follow-up email to Lauren, Tiffany, Kia, Mistrustee re SwiftScore access/usage**

> Yeah, actually, mine, I can send them the follow up as well. can take their info.
> 

**Lauren Overton**

> Okay, cool. All right, so let me get you Tiffany's email. I always forget the she cool fees. They just gave us these little UB keys for like two authentication or whatever, and they are
> 

> so such a pain in the butt okay so every time you type on it and like just go wild okay so that's Tiffany our way actually to treat scriptures and tell them hang on the tower i was to set also and then the kid and then Tiffany Tiffany Tiffany is the SPTO no Tiffany is my AP i actually SPTLs although they use this they don't they don't do the evaluations but i could also give you mistrusty as well those are administrators that i just sent your way okay and mistrusty is i think it's an interesting way um hang on one second yeah but if you want to send this to everybody on one email yeah for sure i can definitely talk to them about like if it's helpful for them um
> 

ACTION ITEM

**Submit request to school district IT for SwiftScore website access**

> and show them what you just showed me. Amazing. And then the only hard part is going to be the thing where it's not allowing us to go through, which side note?
> 

> You don't have to go to procurement for that. I can just request that I can access the webpage.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, would you mind?

**Lauren Overton**Yeah, to view that, to complete the school district could have a blah, if you're an employee of the school district and located in a school facility, may request a further review.Click here, digital and flip this. This application has moved that our application is no longer click here. Okay, it looks like I need to fill out an application for it, but I will just to say I'm using this website.There's like, yeah.

**Will Krasnow**It might give me a report, but who knows? Sometimes they let you through on some stuff. Okay, cool. That would be super appreciated.Thank you. And then I have three emails. I'll send a follow up just briefly explaining it, including next steps how to sign up.And then my ask to you is. Do you think we could set up like a short 10-minute just check in after you do it?So I just love to hear kind of the story of how it went. I'm around, I could do, if you want to do it like right after, we could do like Wednesday, or if you want a little bit more space in between, that's fine.Okay.

**Lauren Overton**Yeah. Wait, so tell me that one more time you said next Wednesday.

**Will Krasnow**Whenever it works, I mean, I could do this Wednesday right after you try it out. I could do next Wednesday.Let's do next week.

**Lauren Overton**Let me look real quick. Yeah. Well, yeah, let's do next week. Two, two, I could do next week at 10 a.m.This time.

**Will Krasnow**The 10th, brother? The 12th.

**Lauren Overton**The 12th at 10 a.m. That's perfect for me.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, cool.

**Lauren Overton**I've got you in my schedule. have to run because I actually have to go do an observation. Okay, cool.But yeah, cool.

You

**Will Krasnow**You hear me? You didn't hear me, Captain?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Hey.

**Will Krasnow**How's going? I'm very, very sorry. No way.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**I had a bit a fight at the end of the day, so I was like dealing with that and then got home and then my daughter was like, can you drive me to work?So I apologize. No, seriously.

**Will Krasnow**No. I will say, I think, can you hear me?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**I can hear you. I can hear you. My volume is down. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**hear you. I can hear volume is down.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Sorry. I went. I do think that it was because I was in the hot spot. Okay. So that's why it wasn't working.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**It was just it was working. It was just taking a really long time for it to work. So I see because the hot spot made it really slow.

**Will Krasnow**Yes.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**So I was like waiting for it. And that's why. it comes up with like a it's a do not do not enter sign.

**Will Krasnow**So it was just taking like a bit of a time.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**I did go on though because my other concern was like I kept putting in like notes in and it was giving me scores of three.So I did some heftier notes on another teacher and I put those in. Let me pull it off right now.Yeah, out of that too. It was amazing. It was amazing. So yeah and I talked to the other AP and I thought it was a kind of show her with it.We have formals coming up so I'm hoping that I can like use it. At the very least it's a helpful it takes everything that you're saying and then it gives you like multiple different ways that I can provide feedback to teachers with it.So I mean I think it's amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Awesome. I saw on there.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**I broke it down by the so. I don't know if this is a wasted meeting right now, I just need to, like, touch base and give you the feedback that I did figure some things out.like I said, even if I have notes and then I come home and I use the program at home, that even is beneficial for me.So, I'm going to continue to use it and I will, I am allowed to continue use it right now.Can I ask you one question now that we're here? It's just something I've been thinking about.

**Will Krasnow**Now, is this something, and this is just helpful as well for the direction of how we think about our product and how we talk about it and everything, how do you expect that this will be received by teachers?Is that something you anticipate even telling them about? and do you think it will help you you know and possibly affect the teacher experience?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**What I tell teachers. I probably wouldn't tell teachers that I'm using it as a tool. And like I said I would take it and try to have it be more in my voice as opposed to like copying and pasting like directly the feedback that I'm giving them in there.Does that make sense? Of course yeah. But I don't know how teachers would receive it. We're living in an AI world and I am actually like most of the time encouraging them to use the chat TPT and things like that.I don't know if I told you so I was doing like coaching teachers before this. I did tell you because so like we were they were encouraging us to use AI and chat TPT because it was like essentially weon her own. I don't know. I that's a good question. I don't know how teachers would receive it. If it would be like, yeah, you need Chachi PT, you're supposed to be coming in and telling me what I'm supposed to be doing and things like that.So I don't know how it would be received that they would be hesitant with it. But I mean, I'm not a technologically savvy person by any means of the word, but I do find this to be like, like I said, even like the Chachi PT and things like that, I just find it to be a incredibly useful tool that we need to learn how to navigate and use for ourselves.Like I said, I'm not going to copy and paste. I'm going to take the feedback and kind of but so I don't think I answered your question.I don't know how it would be received.

**Will Krasnow**Let me frame it this way then. Well, that answers my first question 100%. My second question is this, which is, let's say like now moving.forward, do you think this helps you help your teachers more?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Oh, 100%. I think it makes the feedback more valuable. Nice. Well, it's more specific for one than potentially the feedback that I would give.It breaks everything down. And like I said, biggest thing is not all within your classroom, but the breakdown of like, these are the next steps.These are the suggestions that I'm giving you of like what you can do next. And I think it makes it easier for us as admin, especially like the informal observations.It's not as much because they're like 20 minute pieces. So like you're going in and I can pretty much as soon as I go in like, this is the thing.But I think for an informal observation where it's more in-depth, it makes it a little. easier and time saving, and it gives you, like I said, I like the fact that it gets multiple options that I can pick from for these are the next steps that I think that you should take.So it provides that but also gives us the opportunity to like as admin to decide what is going to be like the most valuable piece of that to give back to them out of like those three different choices.So I mean, it's a valuable tool, but I still think that there is an important like piece of us going in and knowing our teacher and knowing our students and like picking and choosing from this what is going to be the best feedback for them.

**Will Krasnow**That's okay, sweet. That makes a ton of sense. And then my final question is, are you, does your school have any particular focuses right now, like for instance literacy or oror is it like, yeah, is there a school specific focus you guys are looking on working on with, you know, instructional practice?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Yes.

**Will Krasnow**Let me pull up.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Excuse me, one second. Yeah, yeah. So it's not necessarily like literacy or specific like that, but there's specific instructional practices.Yeah. When I go into classrooms, this is my tracker. So PBIS is our school-wide initiative. Right. we would like to see teachers using that.don't necessarily know that that's something that like you can tie into your feedback, but the positive narration is like a huge piece of it where we want to hear teachers like encouraging and promoting on TAS behaviors and things like that that we're seeing in there.Student visuals as like having a nice, but these, again, I don't know how that works within there, but like these companies too, like the lesson plan framework, so there should be like a flow to a lesson, like warm up mini lesson work period, and then some type of closing that goes along with it, having a quality lesson objective, and then communicating clearly verbally, visually, and modeling and things like that, so like those are what we're basically looking for when we go into classes, those couple of main focus areas.

**Will Krasnow**Nice, nice, amazing. Sweet, is there anything else I can help out with?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**No, like I said, I'm going to continue working with it, and we have the formal observations, so they're a little bit longer.have like those questions, I'll shoot you a text or an email and just check in with you, but right now, I have no complaints.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**That's great to hear. If anything comes up, please, yes, text me. And just so I know, when are your formals?

**Catherine Mcphilemy**So the long story of that is we were supposed to have an admin meeting from 1 15 to 2 30 to 15 today.like I said, there was a bit of a scuffle at the end of the day so that admin meeting kind of got cancelled.So I can email you tomorrow with the dates for them, but the spring formals are coming up. think they have to be done by like May.Okay.

**Will Krasnow**mean, that was before May. Okay, cool. That's fine. You don't have to follow up. That's a general timeline is fine.As long as, you know, I'll check in whatever couple weeks or what have you. And cool. We have, oh, I lied.This is my final final question. We have a pitch to Penn just to, we're already working in tandem with Penn GSE, but this is University of Pennsylvania as a whole.Okay, we're just putting down a list of. of essentially the users of the tool and like just their feeling about it.it cool if I put you down and say that you are a user and happy to use it? Four, percent.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Thank you very much. Okay well and if anything else comes up or there's anyone else on the team that wants to use it and they have questions or whatever.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Well I did share, I shared some information with the other AP and then this tracker, let me pull the tracker up again.So I put, go back to this. So for the tracker like this is all the feedback and things that I've been working with like a couple of my teachers.So I took what the notes like I said that I had from the email score. What is it called again?sorry I should know this. Okay. So I put that in there and I'm going to go through. through this with the admin team again, when we have our admin meeting.I'm curious, when they're looking at it, how they'll feel about the feedback and things like that. So if anybody else is interested in any of other APs, I'll share the, is it okay if I share the website with them?Yeah, of course.

**Will Krasnow**Sounds great. Sounds great. Okay, well, have a great day.

**Catherine Mcphilemy**Have a good weekend. You too.

**Will Krasnow**All right, later. All right, back at it.

Break I was here Were you did you have like like Development and stuff like that or you're just doing paperwork It was more than that, you know, had a couple things going on so That it's funny because I was gonna use the app today for the note taker They just an observation so I would love to see how my low inference notes whatever like Came above that.So yeah, let's have to do it and just like I'm gonna take out my next steps Okay, yeah, I think that's a smart idea and then And I also already showed you the platform on my end so this time I could just walk walk walk you through it on your end and just we can get you set up with an accountant YouI have to get better at coding it if I wanted to pick up the way it's supposed to, you know?What do you mean?

**Will Krasnow**just like in the notes?

**Sharda Flores**Like coding it. I need to know like what's the practice I'm going to use to code it so that my next steps are not something I put in there as well.So I get like when we did it the first time, it got picked up as like my next steps got picked up as a glow for the teacher, it got read as evidence and it wasn't.So I have to know how am I coding it? Am I putting student F and then what they did and then T what they did and then am I flucking that and pulling it into the platform?I ducked that was the only thing I had up. Yeah, exactly.

**Will Krasnow**the platform is designed so that you just observe what you don't even really need to.

**Sharda Flores**think about next steps yet just observe what's going on and say teacher said this students said this or us tea whatever it is if you have a template that yeah if you have a template that I can use to take my notes that would that easily gets dragged into that because what I also feel like I was I was doing at one point I did the teacher's name and then I put semicolon that put the teacher initials and I put the semicolon and so it was just just like here and there but if if you have a template that I can use that's something I could just you know quote quote from there right yeah I will send that in a follow-up I'll also just drop it in the chat here like you just

**Chris Lothian**You You You Two minutes and let me run to my office. Thank you, Tom. right. Sorry.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah. I'm on a call. I'm talking about AP. Just give me one second.

**Will Krasnow**You Thank you to your patients, no worries how you doing Chris. I think you're muted. Yeah, so you're saying just one of those days.Yeah, one of those days. No worries. Shout out to you back.

**Christopher Lothian**I am.

**Sharda Flores**Sorry. Is everything okay? Um, for me, that's where you have to be more of a personal whisper than a child, you know, lead instructor and kids with adults, too.Nothing is hard. Sure.

**Will Krasnow**How are you?

**Christopher Lothian**good to see you. Likewise.

**Will Krasnow**We were just talking to Chris that with Sharda, were just talking about low inference notes, and the format to take them, I just dropped in the chat before.But you'll see here, if you just go to the chat in this call, really anything where you just ask for student and teacher teacher, you can do dash, you can do semicolon, you can type out the word, but education will be able to pick it up.And my only recommendation is don't include your perspective yet at this point.

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, just the notes.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Sharda Flores**I was asking him that's because I went into the observation today and like I got code is different. Like I wrote the name of the teacher out and I put semicolon and I put the question and then lower down below I put it just like W for the teacher's initial.And then as I'm seeing things happen, I'm also putting next step to then you'll see SF, NF for next steps because I'm writing and I'm giving suggestions as these things come up.Because if I'm to give my my feedback at the end, I'll forget a few of them. So like I was asking, I was asking Will do you have like a template that I go into these observations?I'm just coding or something that's so then when we transfer, it's something very easy. So I guess the template, right?The difference between you and I is that you I don't type well you can upload they said, right?

**Christopher Lothian**But even with that, like my like I do what you you're talking about, but I just write it on the side like my next steps already start putting it.on the sides of my notes, but of here, I don't, so I don't think about it.

**Will Krasnow**I am, yeah, anyways, I'm literally just messaged the team to double check this, but we're coming out with an update on Monday and on after that update, you'll be able to accept we'll be able to accept handwritten scan and we'll see if your handwriting is good enough and we'll be able to identify it or not.

**Sharda Flores**just want to say like, is your penmanship like?

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, crazy. I'll tell you that. mean, it's legible. Yeah, I mean, listen, I could probably, I just like to say, I can probably transfer, I could have somebody type it out for me, or lose to it.

**Sharda Flores**Oh, you got that. I need that bill thing. I need that type of energy.

**Christopher Lothian**I could pay people to do this. Not cool.

**Sharda Flores**Not money.

**Will Krasnow**In that case, Jake, if someone is open to doing that, it's cool. Also, check with the team just to, well, I'll see how good our handwritten scan is.We can also just try that. For now, Shout out, you want to use?

**Sharda Flores**Yes, I was excited.

**Will Krasnow**serious?

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, yeah, You want to? Don't. What am I playing this?

**Will Krasnow**So, do you have the link to the tool? I can send it if you don't. What in the chat?

**Sharda Flores**Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**Of course. So, I'm going to send you this. You could just copy and paste it into your browser and then present screen so we can see what you're with.

**Sharda Flores**My question is like, my spelling is little bit false, so is that a problem? spelling.

**Will Krasnow**not a problem. Okay.

**Sharda Flores**All right. Let me see. me see my screen. Where's the chat?

**Will Krasnow**Oh, I see, I see, see.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, I see.

**Will Krasnow**So you can just put it and then at this point I would just copy and paste all of those notes into that box right there and then generate report right yeah so it's generate report this will take at this stage about a minute with the update on Monday it'll be 15 seconds but for now we'll just be for that to load and what you'll see and just to catch you guys up I know you already soYou know, all of the different components for Danielson, you'll be able to click into them, see feedback and you're low on print notes.then our recommendation is you can just be and paste that, send that to your teacher, put it into your, you guys are using Power School, right?No.

**Christopher Lothian**No. What was your data management system?

**Will Krasnow**Advanced. Advanced. Right, right, right. you could put it in there and then I'll walk you through the coaching page if you want to do that as well.You guys do, like, put teachers on like six or eight-week coaching plans, right?

**Christopher Lothian**Yep, depending on the teacher, not every teacher.

**Sharda Flores**More so the ones where you're like, yeah, but this helps because it's like sometimes you're like, I don't even know what you need, you just need it all.

**Will Krasnow**So this is based basically on the data.

**Sharda Flores**Like, I'm so, when you talk about grounding stuff in data. And that's been very beneficial. Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, that is 100% the goal. And then as evaluations come in over time, for authors here, you'll see there's this improvement, or there's this decrease.what's that about? And one of the things you're continuously working on too is trying to not only show that data, explain why and how few have the next step for those teachers.

**Christopher Lothian**And with this, like, let's say outside of advanced, would I be able to go into the teacher and put my notes and put just do an observation, provide teacher feedback outside of advanced.Would it be able to do that as well? Yeah, 1,000%.

**Will Krasnow**You could just click, even in the summary here, or if you click on here, what I would do try that is I would click, you see how it says 1A under planning and preparation.I would click on that little button. Here's your summary on the left side, and you could just copy that and put that anywhere you'd like.So we operate independently of advanced, but it could certainly be transferred to it.

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, because I was just thinking like it'd be nice to have all of that in one spot. My advanced, my advanced observations and just all the walkthroughs.So what you think of the background?

**Sharda Flores**I had a question because I'm going back to, I think she had an understanding of it. think it was the actual, because here's the issue.I walked in the teacher, she was really good, animated, interactive, whatever, but there was no learning target projected. was no model projected.I felt like, although she knew like the, like the, how do I say this, how to teach the concept, I felt like knowing that the learning target is important, model is important, that's part of one.I felt like for this particular lesson, it was developing, but this platform rated it effective. Right? Right. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**So, in which case, what you could do is you could just click the box under there, click that box.Click it one time. So, then there you go. You can make it a two. And then you can edit any of these.And so, if you looked at that great path, did that align with some of the next steps of what you saw for that teacher?I felt like the summary piece, yes.

**Sharda Flores**Okay, Let's out and come here. like, I felt like areas of growth, right? So, like, refining that those practices, because not everyone got a chance to share, or it was just the same kids that were, like, point their answers, right?I'm looking at students that learning. are we basically collecting that? There's a couple of other things that I actually have.But this, your spot on, because half the time, it's the wording. Right. I didn't even hear about the model, but it could be in the other section.So I would see why this was, um, in effect, uh, the, this part was developing. Yes. So it aligns very, I just have to read through it to weed out it.But like I said, I didn't write this with the intent, with the intention of just copying and, and putting it here.I now have to code. And that's going to be, that's going to be what's going to make clean it up a little Yes.Yes.

**Will Krasnow**I understand because you didn't necessarily designate when it was a teacher or student. Or not.

**Sharda Flores**Right.

**Will Krasnow**Right. So like here, I put student.

**Sharda Flores**So he said, in my opinion, I would say, I didn't finish the rest of it. But then I asked this child, I said, Hey, where's the learning target?He was like, she didn't put it up yet. I told it properly. This is what some of the things I was concerned about.Teacher dove right into the lesson, which is great. She had good control of the class and she knew her content, but I just wanted to see that live somewhere.Where is the explicit teeth? And that would fall on the developing in one A and one E. Right. I'm planning portion of it.And that makes sense.

**Will Krasnow**mean, one of the things too, and you'll talk like, or I guess here's my question to you is, is it helpful to still have this written out here and have the structure that for which you can then edit me.

**Christopher Lothian**Can you make it larger?

**Sharda Flores**I'm sorry. Come on, you see the font on my phone. I do. I do.

**Christopher Lothian**forget.

**Sharda Flores**I forget.

**Christopher Lothian**Okay, that's good. I can go one more.

**Will Krasnow**Almost the back of the door.

**Sharda Flores**All right, so see here for three three D. That's the, that's the assessment piece. Like, you know, when you say the teacher.Demonstrated a strong grasp. I didn't feel like she didn't eat checks for understanding Except for questions that we had the same so here is it says developing was we developing right yes, so also Just so you know to just something worth understanding is that performance analysis is based on a glow and glow framework So the first paragraph tend to be much more positive So if you scroll down and use the growth path, that's why we know a little bit more into like here's how you could have been So we'll try and keep things a little bit more positive No, but this is good like you guys did it enough We would just have to christopher you and I would have to just change what the um what the the wording is here because this 3d was was developing and developing because there was no tangible like Assessment being done.was one one single entry of assessment, which is basically question and answers Right. So that was why I felt developing Um, but here it says the demonstrated grasp of interest.I see where they're trying to highlight the model The words like strong and that they scream. Okay.

**Christopher Lothian**Well, what does it say in the growth part of that?

**Sharda Flores**Elevate the lesson for the teacher should explicitly connect student annotations to answering questions related to the text. This change would directly address the needs of strength and the feedback.Right. So, like I said, if she said like, I need you guys to stop and drop really quick, tell me and then went around, that would be one way of like gauging everyone's idea of what the question's asking for her, so she's having a few kids popcorn.So, there was no way for them for her to like, to prove that, right? For example, after that, now what you've got lot of end questions.So, she did this. She asked to share their work once again. She didn't pop around to every kid to hear what they had to say.So, that would be my next step to her. I think, like I said, Will, I think this is a really strong platform to kind of like anyone that's starting out with advanced, this is really good, I can see it also being so good, it's a bad thing, but I do like the wording again, it does support a teacher or any kind of any administrator looking for that next step, and a lot of what I was thinking here is what I would write in the afternoon.

**Christopher Lothian**Let me ask you, is this program designed to like the more you put the information and it gets familiar with you, does it adapt and, yeah, does it adapt to the type of feedback or the information that you're putting in?

**Will Krasnow**You're one step ahead of me, so currently no, and we do have a small focus group of principals who do that with them and kind of use them as a proxy for all principals, but on the road map is yes, so this would be like in a more like month.two months time, definitely. And that is 1000% of the roadmap because we can definitely match your voice and as you edit it.So when you edit it, you know, we recommend doing it in the platform and then we can we can match your voice.you're gonna change it on here? Yeah, you could just change the wording right there. It will say or you could copy it and put it on your voice.

**Sharda Flores**Right, so you see it clearly articulating the learning target on the beginning of lesson. So these are things that I identified that it was written in my thing, you know, the learning target pressure mark, right?I would just have to just change some of the time. But I do like the fact that it gives us a basis or like a baseline to start with.

**Will Krasnow**Well, for this Although it was saying that they should incorporate as if they didn't right. They did it. She didn't even So got that one So, yeah, so right here where it says the world and that's something that I would live right here, right?

**Sharda Flores**But you see the way that they worded it to enhance the effectiveness of this lesson versus like The lesson plan was not you know, like again, it's wording right half the person I deal with in just Workly right so why so it is going to elevate the lesson further hence the employment whatever This is great So now what I want to do and I'm not right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to Basically look at then I'm gonna go into the lesson tomorrow and I'm gonna code this way Right my question to you is if I coded like teacher one column student one column, would it?Would there be a problem or do I have to do it like this?

**Will Krasnow**I'd recommend doing it like this the other way should

**Sharda Flores**fine, but this will just ST ST ST would be or was it after I guess like after I'm done coding, I'll just you're just throwing the S in the T.Yeah, and then see how it generates into them. Because it's really nice to just see just to see how low inference notes get into what AI think would be the reading.So now you have a person because I call him once I'm like, Hey, what do you think about this?At least you think it's a back tip? No, right? Go back and forth. So because I also go back to Daniel's in his soul.It's so subjective. Right. Of course. So it's nice to have that that bouncing thing. How long do you have this as a pilot before you got a favor?Yeah, yeah.

**Will Krasnow**So the way that works is it's 10 free uses of the tool. Just like and then afterwards, it's 75 a month.Question.

**Christopher Lothian**Do you have a New York City vendor license? We currently do not So we in the in the interim one of us would have to get the ball rolling on that in order for us to Well pay you to the school's budget Yeah, that's something yeah exactly like that's something I would recommend so currently what most of our users do is this is like They'll use a tool We'll try it out for free and then if they like it they'll pay for a month or two or whatever But then you'll get the ball rolling for the school and then have that coming out to come out of the school I'll be honest with you.

**Sharda Flores**I don't think I would like to share this my I just feel like this is something that Because him and I I think we have a better defined understanding of what of how we rate what's the evidence?And we always go back and hope a second guessing I feel like this is gonna be some somewhat of a of a crush some people if they don't use it already Then you know hey, but I'm not gonna be the out there talking about hey guess what I got this tool I might just first before you and I would be $75 each and so we can get it

**Will Krasnow**And yeah, that's why it's totally a thing. Whatever you prefer. Another thing that is also has been kind of past two.I don't know if you guys are part of principal union or something that could sponsor the use of the tool as well.Again, maybe that's not something you're interested in doing, but we've had people reach out on that as well.

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, but as a way, you're going to have to get vetted, like to go through the process because you're going to have to get vetted through whatever and what DOE, whatever is in charge of guess that's true if you do it that way.

**Sharda Flores**Do you want me to send you the form? Sure, I would love that. The form for the start to bend the process.That would be amazing.

**Christopher Lothian**Question, just to make sure I'm on the same page. So in the sort of show your screen again. Sure.And that's where, let's say I'm typing in my notes, right? I'm not typing them in. I'm just typing all of them in this box.So if I, if I, and wind up if I had typed them out, I would just copy and paste them.How do I go back?

**Sharda Flores**So so charter, let's do this actually.

**Will Krasnow**Go to the top, log in on the top, right? Have you made an account before?

**Sharda Flores**Because this was no, I did exactly just on the website, just put a lot of it. I didn't create what you totally could do.

**Will Krasnow**let's create an account so you can save it at the bottom. So if you go to the bottom here and click sign up and just create an account here.What this is going to let you do is like you can return to these evaluations over time. And then we talk about data for your teacher and everything.That's how it will store.

**Sharda Flores**I guess I'm. Okay perfect.

**Will Krasnow**now if you click the pencil at the top or home, other one, and then you click the new evaluation of right, there you go.You can do the same feature. I'm to throw in. So this is Chris, this is where you put the notes there.And I did actually talk to you. And then you could generate before it.

**Sharda Flores**And then that generates that that bigger report. Christopher, do you find it's hard to code the teacher and the student?Are you in the habit of doing that? Yeah, so I get back.

**Christopher Lothian**That's the only way I remember. But I was thinking like, I don't know if this makes sense, but for some reason for me, I'm just like, if, if I just like, say I have it coded, right?And I have all of my evidence for one eight and I just plugged that in. Would it just go to one a or will it just spread it out throughout?Or we'll find it domains to put it in.

**Will Krasnow**That's a great question. So it will spread it out. That's the way it structured. But then if you click into one a, it will, like that's what I recommend.So let's say you're focusing on a specific teacher. You just want to look at one and you take your notes, however you take your notes, drop them in here, and then just click into the feedback for one a, and then you would have the report just for one a, the other ones will be okay.

**Christopher Lothian**Okay, gosh, if maybe thinking about If I just wanted to focus on specific domains and just like locking them if I if I had the ability to lock out Some domains that I didn't want to I didn't want it to feed in Yeah, that's a great you just get the option of do it What happened to you Shona this oh, sorry, no worries.

**Sharda Flores**Oh sweet Right So yeah, I mean the recommendation because it would be like if you're just doing too I like you have the report for everything, but you just click on to it So it is a little bit like yeah sure you have to pick but then you have the full report there Oh, and it won't include any evidence from to here Okay, I don't know for some reason I thought it might be strong if I just put all the evidence from one and That one domain that I want to focus on I was gonna ask I had a question like that See so now this change, you know that I'll be wrongSo I just copied this, right, and I went into it here, and I put it in, it changed. The score is slightly different.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. this is a facet of the product itself. the way that AI works or any AI tool is that it works on kind of a sort of standard deviation and randomization.So that's why I recommend like always look at it and review it and then put your thoughts into it.Because that I can guarantee from last time to this time the general gist is the same, but the specific score might be slightly different, some of the wording is going to be slightly different, and that's up to you to like review it, make the changes you want to see, and then go into it.

**Sharda Flores**So, well, I had a question for Line from advance. I know the rating. I know the evidence. Is it possible to get like next steps if I already know what's my rating what's my evidence because sometimes as far as a thing right just trying to get like what's that next step for that teacher is it possible on this platform for me to enter Like the actual rating.I was trying to do that by going into my advance. Here's what I would It's a good thought. I think this is the way you would get at the same thing and start a different way if you score the top Yeah Because I'm gonna pull I think I could pull from a teacher's advanced observation and just see what would be her next step With this particular Alright, let me go back here.You see it. Yeah. All right.

**Will Krasnow**Yes. Yes. Go to the top and click the pencil again This time you see Walt I click and click an A So this is gonna be your coaching reportcan click create new report. So you can then pick the specific domain you want to focus on. So let's do like say one, click domain one, and then like we wanted to work on like one E, right?So you can click there and you scroll over and we're going to segment that even a little bit further down into a more bite-sized chunk.So this is not for the evaluation component but exactly what you said specifically. So yeah you can choose amongst these and there's going to be one more sub-criteria you could choose.then that's going to generate a here you go here. This is going to generate a specific coaching report based on that thing.So if you have a next step in advance you can match that and you could scroll here that came out a little funky.I'm sure this will be changed in in the next update on Monday.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah it seems to be present this is my I, that was my thing. as I'm saying, I see where it's trying to pick up, I knew around during the lessons, they were, you know, they were participating, they had their opinion, everyone was, so that was my, you know, so this picked up a strength.So, just starts with group of strengths, and then we'll go into a focus area, so right there, and a series of action steps, and these are all the next steps related to that.Okay, okay.

**Christopher Lothian**You know what I find, I'm looking at what's probably useful too, because sometimes like these lessons are so bad, it's hard to find like a strength.If highlighted something, I can just copy and paste.

**Sharda Flores**If I do, if, how do I go back to evaluation arts? want to go, I want to, I want to put something in.So, would I hit new evaluation? Yep. All right.

**Will Krasnow**So, I also, yeah, go on, so I'll you.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, no, that's okay. This is basically what I pulled from the advanced observation that I worked on because I wanted to see.Oh, wow, it worked. Yeah, wanted to see what would be the next step because some teachers are like, they've done really great and it's effective and highly effective.you're like, what did you just put in? I pulled my advanced observation. I pulled and I wrote this. Teacher displays knowledge of the important concept and discipline and how they make.So then I did, I put in what she said. So yesterday, kids, we worked on long vowels and went out the lessons and we did, that's what she said.That supported that rating that I gave her. So I wanted to know how closely aligned or what would be the next steps that this program would give this teacher.Because, you know, you have your, like, the youth in these worlds who are basically performing at a certain level where it's like, I have to give you, I want to give you feedback.But I want to give you feedback that's just not like, hey, find a PD or hey, I want to give you something that's actually possible that you can utilize.I don't know, people do that, find a PD.

**Will Krasnow**I yeah, I'm sure how this will look like our program is in design to accept that, so I'm not sure what that's going to come out and be, and then the other, but I'm curious, so let me know, the one thing I was going to say is I do have to run.I have a few that I'm going to say for, I'd love to keep this going though. Do you want to schedule some time next week?

**Sharda Flores**What? It's accurate. Yeah, nice.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, so it did pretty well. Cool.

**Christopher Lothian**All right, I was just, I was just curious because half the time.

**Sharda Flores**I would go back to home. Right.

**Will Krasnow**Go back to home.

**Sharda Flores**think you did.

**Will Krasnow**You did that right. I think, again, this. just updates on Monday.

**Sharda Flores**All right, I'm going go to NA, and then going go here, and then you can create before.

**Will Krasnow**And then you can choose the domain and all that good stuff.

**Sharda Flores**And then reflecting on teaching.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. But yeah, so did you guys have time next week? want to keep this going. just, I'm sorry.

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, I have, um, yeah, I'm free. Yeah, next week. I was this time next week.

**Will Krasnow**It's time.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, I'm good. What was that?

**Will Krasnow**It's good?

**Sharda Flores**Wednesday, Wednesday leaving half day on the fifth. Okay, so it's not good.

**Will Krasnow**So no. How about you guys have, um, noon on Tuesday? That works mean.

**Sharda Flores**Hey, hold on. I have something about Cal.

**Will Krasnow**I'm sending the invite to that now you guys can mess around with the tool then and then the cool thing is that Sunday we'll have the new updates as well so we can show you some of the new stuff coming.Okay.

**Christopher Lothian**Thank you.

**Sharda Flores**Thank you very much, Rome. This was helpful. Of Sounds good.

**Christopher Lothian**All right. I'll talk to you guys.

**Will Krasnow**Bye.

**Christopher Lothian**Bye. Bye.

Hello, you?

**Omar Crowder**Hold on. never use this computer. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Great.

**Will Krasnow**I'm not. Hey, Omar, how's it going? Good morning.

**Omar Crowder**How are you? morning.

**Will Krasnow**Thank you so much for moving this online. I really appreciate it. Yeah, so I don't sit on my e-mail, sir.

**Omar Crowder**So I literally was sitting here in my office waiting for you to show up, just as it heads up.I don't sit and start my e-mailing box, so I'm glad that we can make this work as well. I'm actually going to hand you over to Mr.Kress, who's one of our system principals, and Mr. McDaniel, and I'm going to hop off here in a minute.Sounds good.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Omar Crowder**Thanks for putting us in touch.

**Will Krasnow**Of course. And I'm sorry here.

**Omar Crowder**This is.

**Will Krasnow**Mr. Kress, Kress, nice to meet you. Right.

**Omar Crowder**One. Sorry. Are you will at Swiss score.org? That is me.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, yeah. I've seen this.

**Omar Crowder**This tool. Oh, yeah. That's great.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Omar Crowder**Amazing. Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Where have you seen it before? I found a play lab that A.I.

**Omar Crowder**Link to it. Nice. Nice. Where you get that link?

**Will Krasnow**I couldn't tell you.

**Omar Crowder**I think I was talking to a guy building 21. think they're on there. Sure. Yeah.

**Omar Crowder**I forget how I found it. Hey, Will. So really quickly before I hop off, are you guys a current district vendor?

**Will Krasnow**We are not currently a district vendor. We're currently in those conversations now.

**Omar Crowder**Okay. mean, ultimately, I like what I see so far. Um, my definitely, you know, If we were to move on this, the two guys that I would lean on for advice in this area anyway, they need to be sold.And so if this is something that they find value in and would want us to move forward, I would be happy to help with that conversation as well as far as the approval process.That would be our only hangup. If you sell these guys on your products, whether or not we would be able to actually contract with you would be the bigger question.

**Will Krasnow**Sounds great.

**Omar Crowder**Sounds great. Is Brad joining this call, Jeremy? You said you fought in the link, right?

**Omar Crowder**I did, yes. All right.

**Omar Crowder**Well, nice to meet you. going to have you meet with my folks. Sounds good. Super nice to meet you.Take care.

**Will Krasnow**Really? Hey, how's going?

**Brad Mcdaniel**Hello.

**Will Krasnow**When he was saying these two folks, it's you both, right? that correct? That's That's correct.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. if the Philadelphia Academy of school leaders, which is how he knows Omar because they run the program with the Newbar fellowship.So when Omar was part of that program, Matt Kelly was one of the coaches to the Newbar fellows and has been working in for a while.He actually left that role recently and joined Independence Charter School as the CEO there. And during that whole process, he came up with that Playlev tool that Jeremy's been using, which Brad essentially is an AI chat bot that will take your low inference notes and turn it into Danielson evaluations.So what we've been working on together is related to what Omar just said, which is putting that on a secure private environment and soup it up with some cool tools to really make it a professional grade version.What we're doing now is we're going to various Newbar fellows and their APs and granting them access to the tool, which is something we've already provided.Well, we've piloted first with Kelly Espinosa at Fanny Jackson Copin, and then now about, it's coming to about 10 to 20 others.New Bar Fellows in the Philadelphia School District, and then their APs. So what I'd love to do today is just show you the tool, major interest, and if it's useful, I could give you access to it, and y'all can get going right away.To Omar's point, we're currently in the process of becoming a district vendor and like having those procurement discussions. So if you want to use the tool, which most of the principals are doing is like, it just would be either on a hotspot or on your own Wi-Fi, or if you're like, you know what, I'd rather just wait, that's cool too.And then the final thing I'll say too, before jumping into it, is look at the tools not useful, like, no worries, no need to use it, just be straight up with me.And we also, like, this is not a pitch or so. We are working with the New Bower Foundation and also Penn Graduate School of Education to work on having this tool be sponsored for the use of principles and APs like yourself.So at no point am I going to be like asking you to open up checkbook as well. What's your background?Yeah, my background is I am graduating from the University of Pennsylvania this May. I founded Swiss Corps about a year ago with my brother.It started because of a conversation I had with my English teacher who said if I won the lottery I would still teach but I'd pay somebody to grade.So I've been kind of circling around all these problems in education with educators who or love their jobs really good at what they do but are drowning in paperwork and seeing what I can do as an educator listen and hopefully provide some useful AI tooling.most of what we do is pretty connected to the Penn Graduate School of Education as well. connected to like the research that they publish and stuff there.Are you an undergrad or grad school?

**Omar Crowder**Undergrad, I'll be great. Okay, so you're not with like the GSEs like catalyst program or you're just on your own?I am with a catalyst program.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, sweet. Which has been great. Are you familiar with it?

**Omar Crowder**Oh yeah, I would depend as an undergrad actor to end grad school. Cool. I get their emails.

**Will Krasnow**know they have an interesting online education program.

**Omar Crowder**I can get them more money, but it looks like that.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. you get emails from a guy named John Gamba?

**Omar Crowder**Possibly. I don't know. have long news days.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, cool. then before showing you the tool, mind if I ask you guys just a couple of questions. You guys are the APs.Are you creating the teacher evaluations at your school? Or is that Omar's? What are you creating? So presumably you have to take low inference notes and turn them into

**Brad Mcdaniel**evaluations or is that something that Omar's doing and you actually doesn't we do okay great and you guys provide the scores as well yeah okay cool how many teachers are you handling each a week there's also there's five babies just FYI we're just a two of the five um that's good we we do our four moles uh for our own teachers we talk about oh we have 35 Brad yeah we just told that we don't do four moles you probably each about 15 teachers of four moles a year it seems that's about 25 to 34 moles so we're using biennostin officially 25 to 30 times a year got you and what are you guys doing for your informals uh so and we have an internal tracking form where we have basically components of dangos and that we kind of keep it in on as important uh so like one from every one of the uh the domains and then we just get like feedback on those so it's likelike seven questions. And then a teacher gets a summary of just like this. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**And are you guys managing that on like, is that like just at Google Forms or related?

**Brad Mcdaniel**Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**terms of, let's say you take low inference notes, you convert them to evaluation, how long does that usually take you per evaluation?It depends.

**Brad Mcdaniel**I'm particularly slow for me.

**Omar Crowder**If I can write up the form. I'm looking at, honestly, probably an hour and a half. Yeah.

**Brad Mcdaniel**think I've adjusted to the framework. The system is lower. used to require you to enter in a comment or text for every single component that you store.The newer framework allows you to get like summary feedback. And then you can put in the individual feedback you have to.

**Will Krasnow**So.

**Brad Mcdaniel**If I were to do all of them, about 40 minutes to an hour, least, if you just do like the new version, where it's like a summary feedback with an action step, a lot of experiments.Nice.

**Will Krasnow**Got you. And then in terms of coaching, you guys are involved in the coaching process as well. Are you guys coaching each of your teachers, or specifically a select group?

**Brad Mcdaniel**What was that, sorry?

**Will Krasnow**Well, we all have a case load of teachers. Got you. But does every teacher get a coaching plan focus, or is it a certain teacher's designated for coaching?I guess, can you define coaching on your end?

**Omar Crowder**Yeah, I guess.

**Will Krasnow**Well, yeah, I mean, I'd be interested in what it looks like from what I typically hear is either, you know, I'm a principal of AP.I have certain teachers. I'm looking to coach. It could be all of them. And I want to put them on like a six-week, eight-week coaching plan.to tackle a specific way to improve their practice. though I understand it's super different at different school. So I don't know, is that baked into the evaluation process as well, or how do you guys think about it?

**Brad Mcdaniel**So I get what you're saying, so the size of this school and the scope of our responsibilities. When it's creating and managing a 15 point for every single teacher.So we usually focus energy on teachers that are not proficient in their valuation. So you're generally like pressing saying we'd have like 30, teachers that are on our caseload within that 30, 35 you have approximately 50, 50% of the teachers are in their form of year.And then out of those 15, they've might not be the same ones that are being more intense coaching support.You might have some better teachers. And we also do departments so it could be math teachers that I'm coaching in both of the transfer.So it's not a like 100% of the teachers don't get it because we don't have the bandwidth to do all of our teachers and do all of the other things that are required in the school.So it out of our long answer to say out of our you know a lot of teachers maybe 10% of that have like you know more consistent evaluations that are involved with check-ins and action items to be back and all that stuff.Got you.

**Will Krasnow**Completely makes sense. Cool. Okay, amazing. are you guys using the last question? Jeremy using the you're using the PlayLab a little bit.Brad, he used any AI tooling to assist in this project.

**Brad Mcdaniel**And Jeremy how has it been?

**Will Krasnow**You said it was Could are you using it for most evaluations?

**Omar Crowder**You just twin around with it just going around, but I think it helps Put pen to paper except not something I would I feel comfortable Coping and pasting yeah for sure.Um, I think if it was known out of the final copying and I think I think the issue is Like if you're saying I put my notes into AI and here's what here's what like the plan said.I think that's one Awesome way to go Yeah, we're not we're not there.

**Will Krasnow**So I feel uncomfortable doing that That makes sense. Yeah in my own thoughts.

**Omar Crowder**I think I use it to help me get my thoughts Together and then I edit it to to be more me.Yeah, that makes sense.

**Will Krasnow**I mean also in line with the institutionalizing the the system and um getting like Like if this was a tool sponsored by phil esd that's a you know probably different story 99 I've even wanted real we don't get into we don't do a time

**Omar Crowder**This year we have an a ton of like what we call walk throughs like quick check-ins. They're sure sure I think you didn't know anything if we ramp that up.I'd be very sure my my people like hey, here's what I'm gonna do Like You know, mean, I think we're not doing that necessarily if I'm not like no, I wouldn't want to do that Be me, I'm using as like I know I think I'm just pushing it off Like I took my notes.

**Will Krasnow**Here's what the output was then I think that's a different point of frame it Got you completely understand You guys have any low inference notes handy that you're looking to turn into an evaluation if none I can pull a sample one Thank you you.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**All right, sweet. So let me show you the tool as I'm pulling this up. I'll say the whole for me is To save you all a little bit of time Turn what's maybe an hour an and half into maybe 30 minutes or what's 30 into 15?You Free up some of the time to be in person with these teachers and coaching them, one half of it, and then the other half is hopefully help you provide more touch points to those teachers.if you're doing an informal, maybe that feedback can be a little bit more robust because you have this tool, or because you can quickly create a coaching plan or a coaching focus, you can give that to even more strong teachers who are looking to get just a little bit better.And then the final component of all this is when it comes to storing and tracking your teacher's progress over time, because we're building this specific environment for instructional coaching that's AI powered, what we'll do is we'll store your informals, your formals, and then show you how the teacher is doing and flag certain areas of, hey, maybe you should look at this teacher or for this teacher, you should look at this.some conclusions from them. these are going to be on the different Denison domains. And we structure around glow and grow framework.So it's going to be like, here's what happened and some of the good things that worked. And then here are the suggestions we recommend, like your given action step for this specific domain or component of the domain.So you'll see here, I have a score. The teacher did pretty well. Got a 3.6. I have the different domains of Danielson.We leave professional responsibilities blank. If you have other things that, you know, what's to include there, you could, that's happens outside of the classroom.You can change any of these scores if you disagree with it with the AI. So one of the things that we're really big on is like, yeah, generated by AI.It's a way to do 50, 70% of the work, not all of it. And you're still the instructional coach looking into it.When I got a specific domain, like, B, I can find, here are the low inference notes I uploaded on the side, some of the evidence it's drawing from, and then on the left, here's the summary.So I'm going to see this performance analysis, teacher demonstrated a strong understanding of their students' needs, yada yada yada, this is going to be pretty long, and for each of the components right away.And then it's going to generate a specific growth path. And here are the specific steps that we'd recommend that the teacher implement in their progress towards growth.Now my guess is that this is going to be a little bit long and might be nice to see as instructional coach, but when you're giving it to your teacher, one of the things we recommend is you click this button and we'll generate a teacher-specific summary.So if I show that, this is a one paragraph summary of the robust feedback we provided to you, and it's designed to be a little bit more.Thanks. The teacher did well. Now if I go back to here and if I signed into an account within Swift Score, I'm going to see my different teachers, the number of valuations I have in the system and the percent change over time.So this is a way where we want you to visualize what's going on with the teachers that you're covering.Maybe you've been organized them by PLC or Ability, whatever makes sense for you. And if you click into a specific teacher, you'll be able to see an average of all their scores.So this is going to look very similar, but it shows an average of how they performed across their different evaluations.And if I want to define a specific coaching focus, so this goes into that realm of like, all right, maybe I did an informal, maybe I did a formal with this teacher, this teacher needs a little bit more of a boost and I want to create something a little bit more robust.My guess is you're probably not going to be like, here are all the million different things you can work on, but hone into something specifically.So, in this kind of coaching building page here, you can click on a specific domain, click on a sub domain, and then AI is going to suggest a couple options within 2C that you can then generate based on.So let's do streamlining transitions and routines. And then one even more bite-sized focus area from there to get into the implementation strategy.And once you ironed out all of these things, we could do, say, enhancing routine consistency. What AI will do is now generate a specific coaching report for this teacher, and you'll see that here.This was made today. We're focusing on 2C. It's going to start again with glows, here are some strengths that it had, and then go into the specific key growth area, along with evidence fromlow inference notes and a coaching plan with action steps that build on each other, each with an implementation timeline.They're also tied with specific smart goals that we recommend you look at and maybe evaluate and consider the teacher on.Then when you're done, you go back to this page and create a new evaluation or see your different teachers.We all see a total average of your Denison scores and evaluations. As I mentioned before, this is not really designed to do what you do and as I'm sure you saw there are limits and it's not 100% perfect, but the hope is it provides a certain structure to make it little bit more streamlined, AI assistance to save you time and help you think about these problems and then provide some more touch points and visualize the growth over time.The final thing I'll mention and then I'm super interested in what you guys think. Well, we don't.

**Brad Mcdaniel**So, for the viewer, putting up a variety of in the viewer selecting options while they have something more for a bill of disabilities, how easy is it to adjust the filters on the bill of these schools to create, so, like, number one, what I see is a non-elimitation, but, so, like, professional responsibilities, like, that's something that's very easy to just, it's like, are you receptive to the feedback that you're receiving in your evaluation?know, did you, in your post observation, would you, like, make some kind of meaningful recommendation for something you would change, and, like, do you live up to a professional responder, which is only two indicators that a school district uses?And I'd be curious to be, like, deleting that on this entirely, and just letting that be, I don't think it's needed for this.Just because it's like those two things, like what is the conversation like between your teacher and are they reflective and like do they show up on time?Because if you don't put those notes in to your, I don't, I never put those as informal notations. So it's never going to get a high score for professional responsibilities.Right. makes sense. Yeah, I think that's a fair point.

**Will Krasnow**So what we've done here is we'll never school based on the notes for professional responsibilities. So this is not, it's not a zero.

**Brad Mcdaniel**No, it does read a zero.

**Will Krasnow**But maybe that, that it should be changed. It's blank. So this is in fact, during into the score. And we provide the user to then input what other external I want to input.But I can see how that zero is a little bit misleading. Well, I was looking just when we had it as the.

**Brad Mcdaniel**How do I fill up these fields in stainless and there were actual like numbers. Which one it might not have been.No, no, I think that's.

**Will Krasnow**That's a fair point. That's it.

**Omar Crowder**that's like, they can, we were compiling the entire world's knowledge to pick up what I saw and do something that's useful.It's, that is, it's funny you mentioned that.

**Will Krasnow**So tomorrow I'm going into Jackson coffin. And we are sitting down with their APs and principal. And we're talking about just that.So the goal for us is like, you're one step ahead. Essentially, like, well, if you have your evaluations in here, right?You have your informals, your formals, and giving scores, right? Why not be able to generate a specific trend report or help define like a coaching or specific focus for the district as a whole?And then if you were to create such a trend report, you could totally upload like, Hey, I did a walkthrough on this day.Here are my notes from evaluating one C across X teachers in this, these subjects. What do you think about all that?Because I think that's a great point. next next year of before we're going and I'm I'm going on a different instead of Philly or Nicholson.

**Omar Crowder**Yeah, it's yeah, it's in sub set. Is that currently an option or no? even the trinity level.

**Brad Mcdaniel**I was thinking about that.

**Omar Crowder**I'm looking for like my own personal use. I just want to do a Danielson set, uh, evaluation, a Danielson.

**Will Krasnow**Wait, let me make sure I understand what you're saying. So you're saying, Oh, oh, oh, you're saying if I just want, but I don't need all of all of these components here.I just want to look at one beat.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Yeah. One beat.

**Will Krasnow**You're seeing three.

**Brad Mcdaniel**I just quit.

**Omar Crowder**I will type a note and the program. I'm sure it's probably better output to if the internet knows that if AI knows I'm only looking at those three.That's you. Those are going to be little more tailored to those three. Understood. So here's what I recommend.

**Will Krasnow**Actually, you try it out just like as it is here because the way that we prompt our AI is essentially each time you click into two B or one C, like this feedback is like it's a new AI.discussion each time so you're still see right like all right let's say you didn't care about yeah you'll still see that there but I just click into 1b you can copy and paste this edit it here and then when you define a coaching focus for a teacher on that other page the reason we do structure in such a way where you pick the domain and then you pick the sub domain is because let me show you this here you'll be able to see here these aren't defined but actually a little trend of like here's how this test teacher did on 2c over time so you could see how that does not just for the whole entire evaluation but just that specific component you're interested in looking at.

**Brad Mcdaniel**So there I think I'm very good say that question because that was that was going to be like could we just change instead of having two of these schools can we have one that is walk through where every automatic rules are done soI think that it's only going to fit into one of those and it's not going to live anywhere else.It's only going to live in those components, because that's all AI is. Thank you very much. How difficult is it to create a part of instead of brandless?

**Will Krasnow**Just to make sure I get this straight. You're saying you're walked through how many, how many of like one and one be are covered in the wall?Like we have six total. So you're just saying you just want to report for the six. Correct. That should be easy.We could do that because again, we're with a normal one. It's the same thing we did from Danielson to Philly schools, right?There would just be a different toggle and it would be like, right?

**Omar Crowder**I think that's what we're looking for because teachers, it's very hard to give teachers, especially when I use this quickly.

**Will Krasnow**Teachers don't want to see all of it.

**Omar Crowder**They would be, I think they get overwhelmed and potentially offended. know, like a walk through, it feels very scary.If you start walking through and giving them 15 different subsets, they start panicking and they call it a... Well, we're informal, we're informal.We just want to see how your questions. We just want to see how the classroom procedures was flowing. know, teachers are much more, said like, oh, They were just doing a quick, a quick stop.And so like, if we want to have a report that we can then ever showing teachers, you know, like using, downloading and exporting and sort of like showing that behind the curtain on the teacher side, calling our office.We, that's the reason we think that we want to see that. Sometimes plus is more for teachers. Right.

**Will Krasnow**No, no, I think that's, that's something we could totally do. Um, one of the things we also recommend also is like, we even like when you're talking to a teacher too, like it's rare that we'll see like one of our users like, all right, here's the entire thing that we show on, on Swift score.It's like they'll copy and paste the feedback for 2B and then send it to them in like an email, or they'll put that in power school or what have you.But in terms of just creating that, here are the 6 components. Yeah, if you guys were interested in doing it, like that wouldn't even be like that that would be something you get I think even the next step then would be game those six components As one goopoo knock as an export I guess right now.

**Omar Crowder**Can you export? Can you export everything? Is there an export button right now? You can export the coaching page.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, and then for each individual Box like you have to be or to see you could just click the copy button there.Okay What I'm what I'm getting you saying is like if there's the button at the top right that just said export It gives you a Google Doc and it's like here are all the components of the walkthrough all six.

**Omar Crowder**Yes, not all not all I don't need other BS. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good Because it's what it right now We have a Google form and that we do autocraft and it goes to a PDF and it gets emailed automatically of just our own personal notes For the teacher to a teacher we don't have the AI component obviously got you

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, but that's something we could totally, uh, totally do. That one will be a little bit harder, but still very manageable.

**Brad Mcdaniel**So how, uh, in that coaching summary, how, um, you, is this very, like, it's, it's a lot, like, just looking at it, like, it's a lot, and like the feedback that we make every teacher is, um, you know, two sentences, like, in your next two, uh, and like, in the next one, like, there was one, it was like, in next one to two weeks, implement two, uh, to three turn and talks, uh, within, like, your, your classes.Like, it's very short and succinct, and then the, so that, like, I guess, how do we change the focus like, here's the thing that we want them to focus on, and just, like, provide a high leverage action step before this, and only this.

**Will Krasnow**Can I show you something, and you tell me if this is better, and be honest with me, if it's not, um,is what's coming and what we're building now. I showed you our current one because this is just going to be a design.So when you define a focus, it's going to show over the top here, here's your specific thing. You'll still get a couple of strengths and then it's a six to eight week coaching plan based on very specific action items and you still have an implementation strategy and goals, but it's designed to emphasize here's the thing you're working on as opposed to like this huge essay about coaching or whatever.Is this kind of in the realm of what you're talking about?

**Brad Mcdaniel**Yes.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Short of the Saints. Yeah. And I mean, this even for the feedback, so like what I'm thinking is like, so when we do games, with the newer way that it's that you put it is basically just a summary box at the bottom where you really don't have so good pattern.Teachers to not look at every single component. Yeah, just like here's just fours of the component But as it just an overall and then drop this in the last summary box It's like here's what we're gonna focus on between two three four And like this is what you should take in from your overall observation Because I like if i'm a teacher and i'm like all I care about is the number I don't care what how you came over the number unless it's back So like then you can be like hey our conversation around this one is like you can see it in the summary It's clearly your class of management is terrible.So that's where our actions start Right like this is so this is this is it right here just one three Once you can arrive is there more on this page or is this it?It would go to six, you know, right? I mean even like even if it just went to three actions um Because like honestly like we're we're really only gonna give a teacher one action step per week But if you get them three and say like we're focusing on one Two and three is where we're goingyou do that whole process all over again, it generates another three.

**Will Krasnow**I love that. That's a great idea. Yeah, let's let's let's keep it thin and precise. I'm glad we're on the right page with this because we were like, we were excited before about this vogue being a coaching report and then we got essentially that feedback, which is like, this is a lot of text.It's a lot, yeah. I mean, I was starting to scroll through it.

**Brad Mcdaniel**was like, that's a and you're not even the teacher, right? So you can only imagine.

**Will Krasnow**Fair. Cool. Yeah. like the screen a lot.

**Brad Mcdaniel**This one, like with, and we didn't even like pick some two to three. The fewer the better because it really is like, I think three is like, and like, here's our three, that way they see where it's going, but like, we're going to focus on one because then you get into one of like, if you're focusing on the one, you potentially are going to do another option.and it might generate a full-nother set of action steps. might not even three, you might just need two. hey, gonna do one and two, these are one and two, the first very focusing on one.When we see some good evidence of one, you can start working on two with the support of an admin, but like, then you're gonna probably get generated in another set of action steps that are the most impact with where you are, Right, right.

**Will Krasnow**It's a great idea, it's great. I love it. That's something we can do. And that wouldn't even be like something specific to you all.It's kind of the direction we've been thinking about anyways. That would just be kind of the tool.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Yeah, I would absolutely use that screen. inside of the screen, we do like the six component purpose for like the afterwards, and then I pull it up in the school's purpose for that.like it.

**Will Krasnow**Cool, okay, so let me get this straight, correct me if I'm The core things are cool tool, AI seems useful, things that you're interested in seeing are a way to filter just for the components you care about, right, which is your six components in the software, way to export that easily, ideally straight to the teacher, right, because it's kind of like it's not going on.It looks like this, this would be a good thing we better a teacher, anything more than this would not, I would say.Sure, and then this, with actually just a little bit less, one to three. Now here's a question, one of the things that we are, let's kind of think about it in two ways, and of course it's different in each school, but I'm curious what you guys think about it.It's like...

**Brad Mcdaniel**And these two action steps, we're going to do another observation. So now you're everything changes to your coaching plan will change.So there's no reason to keep like a formal coaching plan. going to generate a coaching plan based on a rock fruit food.It should all be the same. So our formulas would be the same type of feedback. And it should put in theory, generate.can get scores off that information.

**Will Krasnow**You should generate this and just say like, Hey, so we went and we were looking at six.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Now we're looking at the full level of opponents. We can still go randomly like, Hey, like, here's just your overall observation on the deals and framework that was defined by the football school district.However, our coaching remains the same. were focusing on those six items. based on that, here's the three action steps or the two action steps that you have.And this is your cook. Like this is where we are in that. So like over time, it would show us like what, what like generally what teachers we're doing in our school, like they're moving from best to best.some common access steps, and we should see the trends of like, oh, we get a teacher and they're weak here.This is kind of where they land, and this is what we should expect as a progression based on the teachers that have built here, you know, earlier in the year or last year or then.I understood.

**Will Krasnow**When you, are you saying every time you create a new evaluation, there's a different coaching plan?

**Omar Crowder**I don't, I think every school does coaching plans differently. We don't necessarily have a hard and fast coaching plan.Like, we give feedback to work on. Maybe it's the same thing and it's a continuation, but at least at our school, we don't necessarily have a codified coaching plan for a teacher.It's like a binder. It's like, you know, here's my pull it to pull the viewer first and name out their page out.like, here's their coaching plan. I think that's, yeah, we don't have that at this, at our school where it's a lot of understanding.

**Brad Mcdaniel**That's, and I think that's where the next step for this tool for us. is that it creates a fluid coaching plan.So there's no more, we have this binder coaching plan. It's just like, here's what we see, we've input all of our low-income nodes.Here's the generated coaching plan, and it's fluid. So it's going to change. And then after two observations down the road, it may have progressed.So it's going to automatically pivot them to a different set of actions based on their current performance. So like, it basically becomes the coaching plan.And we just kind of roll with it. Everything in one place, which could be really awesome. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Cool. I love it. I love it. Yeah. Certainly do something like that. And I think that's the direction we're going anyways, right?is more concise, connected, what a map, right? Sweet. Well, you've given me a lot to also bring back to the team too.We're probably going to have a lot of discussions about this. Do you guys want to use the tool? Sure.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**When, when would you want to use it? I mean, I could give you access now.

**Brad Mcdaniel**So you said we guess so when you're saying it's not a vendor, it's not a crucial to operate on the school.Yeah, exactly. But yes, like we, you're in terms of like paying down the road, like, a yellow vendor being like, you can accept operating attention.What was that? So the approved vendor, we use that in a way of like, you're putting to use the Wi-Fi and network and access data, which for this case, you don't need access data because we're not, like, putting teachers names and everything in it.But like a district vendor is also someone that can receive funds as payment through our, you know, operating. Yes.we are in the process.

**Will Krasnow**But have neither yet.

**Brad Mcdaniel**You want to use it?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, just leave up some names and either go on a hotspot or home one. Okay.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**When, so I know, when's the next time you guys anticipate throwing some stuff in it? So I can just check in.

**Omar Crowder**I guess I mean, I would be happy to try it for more than shooting to catch schedule one the next week or two, probably next week as my goal.Sweet.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Sounds good.

**Will Krasnow**sometimes it is sometimes don't so totally your call interested in when you're doing it, hopping on a call with me and I can make sure we're familiar with how to use the tool and feel any questions you have then.

**Omar Crowder**Or you guys feel like you got it and just can shoot me an email back up with the vendor parks and I tried going to switch score.org there day because I saw the email.Yeah. It's a new. Yes. So.

**Brad Mcdaniel**How do we how do we access this?

**Omar Crowder**How are people access this on the school district? Yeah, that's fine Okay That's that's what you were meeting. Okay, so like Is that a vendor issue or is that like that's just a new It's a I believe it's a vendor thing because just like just links that aren't approved We'll just automatically get blocked I don't think so.I think it's a new website thing because you can go be I mean Oh, if the whole world is open to us on the internet Now, well some of it's blocked.

**Brad Mcdaniel**So when you really say about what happened It says this is a new link blocked Does it say like here?

**Omar Crowder**talk We've scored that word right it says one thing Uh, it says it's an imma cross this website is in block It's for educational.

**Brad Mcdaniel**I'm interested on So, but I think you send it downtown, uh, they'll like clear. So like, it's just like when you have a teacher that wants to use a certain website, you just, you ask permission from IT and end up with it.And I don't think that's a vendor issue. That's just, IT doesn't block it.

**Omar Crowder**Correct. I would get that done if we just request it.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Oh, sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, if you guys were open to requesting, that'd be awesome. Yeah, I think it's a good, the new site.

**Omar Crowder**The vendor is, yeah, because like, in theory, a lot of those that are not vendor are not approved for tech, but they're not blocked.Yeah, it's like not supposed to have kids make accounts. Cool. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**Well, yeah, if y'all were open to send it in a note somewhere at IT and be like, yeah, I'll do that.

**Omar Crowder**I got it. I got it open here.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Because it's all it is, it's just access to the website. It's not linking our, you know, mainframe student data to, it's just access to it.

**Will Krasnow**I understand, I understand.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Well, would it be an AI, they might. It might be a issue, but it's operating off the Gemini. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Sounds good. Do you guys want to schedule like a call for something next week when you guys actually use the tool or you guys feeling good?

**Omar Crowder**How big is it?

**Brad Mcdaniel**Do you need our emails?

**Omar Crowder**Yeah, I'll just send it to you.

**Will Krasnow**And then once I set the formal, I can email you.

**Omar Crowder**you. I would have won. I would have won as much as I think I can. Brad, you're going to be out, right?Yeah.

**Brad Mcdaniel**We're not going to do that. Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Sounds good. Also, I need to follow up stuff. Let me know. I'll go back to the team and talk about the stuff you talked about.We talked about here and keep doing the loop.

**Omar Crowder**You know, emails are not on this. Oh, that's a good point.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. You mind?

**Brad Mcdaniel**Yeah. don't. Are you guys on the invite?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Omar Crowder**okay. So I'll get it from.

**Will Krasnow**Perfect. Um, Yeah, sweet. thank you very much for your time. Anything comes up? I'm here and have a great day.

**Brad Mcdaniel**Thanks as well. All right.

Hey Chris, how's it going?

**Christopher Ziemba**Hi. Hey, can you hear me? No? you hear me?

**Will Krasnow**I can hear you. Can you hear me? I can hear you. How's it going?

**Christopher Ziemba**I'm well.

**Will Krasnow**are you? Very good. Enjoying the Friday morning.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yes.

**Will Krasnow**Same here.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah. How was the week? It was good. Yeah. We had Monday off. That's always nice. Yeah, it's been relatively smooth.Which is great. Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Christopher Ziemba**The Lenfest campus, right?

**Will Krasnow**Lenfest campus.

**Christopher Ziemba**The market in Philadelphia.

**Will Krasnow**Seven to twelve.

**Christopher Ziemba**650 students. Okay. I mean, kind of medium. Yeah. I mean, teachers. I think right now we have like 39.Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**And now tell me, you know, Matt Kelly from New Valley. Yeah, I was a new Bauer fellow.

**Christopher Ziemba**And so I can work with them post new Bauer. He's involved like, sort of later in my fellowship and like, has like an interest in AI.I like, I've been using some like, he was using like play lab or something to create programs for us.And so I've been using those intermittently, especially for firm observations, which have been actually really helpful. It seems like the partners would have evolved.And I've been using them pretty religiously now to inform like my firm observation feedback. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**So yeah, tell me how are you using it? You'll upload your notes, see what it says, and then kind of use that as a conversation.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, so I take I take lots of low inference notes. So like the more the better, essentially, it feels like I've tried like, I tried once to record the class and then you choose the log.

**Will Krasnow**Which student is talking, right? Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't as effective.

**Christopher Ziemba**It kind of got it right to be honest. but like it wasn't as good, I find the low inference notes with some of my like, I would do this, right?even that stuff like works, like it gives it some direction, which is awesome. And like, I find it's like, just gives me the language a lot easier.Like, you know, I'm not like, yeah, you don't have to be like, you need to everyone. It's like, if you have to work on this and the person has to work on this, like, it can be pretty similar.It's not, it doesn't have to be rocket science, right? Especially when I'm, I'm sure, in the situation season, you have a lot of formulas to, to give.

**Will Krasnow**How many evaluations are you given a week?

**Christopher Ziemba**I'm in the midst of, so I am currently, I don't have enough system principal instructions, so I'm in the, I'm currently doing 27 targeted, like this week and next week, and then formalized, I mean, we do all 39 teachers, not just me but like my team.And those, well, I mean, you're in the class. from for an hour, depending on the teacher, it could be another hour, hour and a half to complete the document.mean, I think I've gotten more efficient over time, but you know, I always want to like, I think with efficiency comes lack of clarity, lack of detail, you know, like, and so finding that middle ground I think is super helpful.Nice.

**Will Krasnow**And the play lab has been helpful in that process.

**Christopher Ziemba**For sure.

**Will Krasnow**Right. Not perfect.

**Christopher Ziemba**like, yeah, but it, you know, I feel like it's like learned our standards more significantly over time, and that's really much, much better results.I used it this summer when I was not impressed at all. Yeah, we did like some like norming stuff at summer PD and that sort of thing.just wasn't I actually put it away. I'm like, I'm not using it. And then some of my colleagues were using it, and I was like, oh, you tried again.it's been, yeah, pretty impressive, to be honest. That's incredible.

**Will Krasnow**That's incredible. Yeah. And so you say your team's helping you do the evaluation, but you don't have APs. So who's helping you?have instructional coaches or? Or no, I do.

**Christopher Ziemba**I should have an APs on maternity and the other resigned in January. I have another coming on board. So it's just a weird time at our school.Like I'll have more folks.

**Will Krasnow**I typically don't do the bulk of the observations.

**Christopher Ziemba**My APIs do.

**Will Krasnow**OK.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, but right now I'm doing them, which, you know, it's good to go to the classrooms. Yeah, but it's like giving me more of an opportunity to kind of like think about the process, think about, you know, I don't want people at seeing a desk writing observations all day.want them in classrooms like using the observations to develop a teacher, right? Like that's the goal. And yeah, I'm hopeful like we can continue to work towards that path.Yeah, 1,000 percent.

**Will Krasnow**Well, that's a pretty great transition to what we do. If it's all right, I'll give you a little bit our story, what we've been doing early, and then show you what we got.OK.

**Christopher Ziemba**OK, so essentially.

**Will Krasnow**I'm at Matt about a year ago. So, and in the past six months, we've been working together and exactly the tools that you've been using, right?So when you talk about Play Lab being like, all right, it's kind of fine. I'm not gonna use it to like, oh wow, this is great.What we've been working on is that next stage, which is like is nailing it. And when you talk about, all right, we wanna make teacher evaluations as efficient as possible without compromising any of the details, any of the feedback.That's exactly what we're after here. But to your point, efficiency still does matter, of course, because you want yourself or you're getting in the classroom, being able to see teachers and then providing, you know, coaching plans and a lot of questions for everyone.So, what we built is on a separate and secure environment eval by SwiftScore. And essentially what that is, is we'll do a very similar thing.You upload your law inference notes, great, you're taking a lot of law inference notes, the more not. That's the better.It will take that crunch and evaluation in a format that is structured for your needs. Are you using Danielson?No.

**Christopher Ziemba**OK, do you all use? Everyone set of standards.

**Will Krasnow**OK, so that's something, and this is where I have a thought to, and I'll get to that in a second, but we could build out it for master each specific standards.I'm sure it's not terribly different. Anyways, so it could then pop up within Swift Score, provide feedback and evaluations that we think are a little bit more aligned than what the PlayLab's currently throwing.And then have that all be stored within Swift Score so that you could track and map teacher growth over time.So you could say, this now impacting, or I could see, wow, this is a big growth from the last evaluation, but then this one dips.So what's going on there? And I can step back and kind of see all. My teachers and then the final part of it all is we have a coaching Like report Sweet so you can build coaching like six-week coaching plans for your teachers on the fly And again, everything's editable, but you know, we hope this could help with that next step of like what are we going to do to help grow this teacher?Yeah, yeah, yeah, we put it all together. We started with Kelly Espinosa at Fannie Jackson cop-in and And then now we're bringing it to We have about 20 new Bauer Fellows who are using that now bringing that to about 30 And what we're doing in this is why I mentioned I'm particularly interested in master's use case is We're giving it free access and Then we're going to new Bauer and saying hey, you know, your principles are using the tool and What we're and we brought pento see, and they're fully committed to this, is we're going to convene the principles using the tools and actually get a post-doc or professor to evaluate the effectiveness of the use.then at the same time, of gauge feedback and prove the tool, kind of, I mean, it's essentially continuing all the process of you trying out PlayLab and then using it and just getting that feedback and making it better.Okay. in that, we would sponsor the use of the tool for principles like yourself and your APs.

**Christopher Ziemba**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**The other thing that is interesting too, and then I'll go on to actually showing you the tool, is does the name Ian Connell bring a bell to you at all?Ian Connell.

**Christopher Ziemba**No. He's with the Charter School Growth Fund.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. You all are connected to them, right?

**Christopher Ziemba**I think some individuals in our organization, not that I'm aware. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**interesting. I thought that y'all were in their network. Or can that they were helping like they provided funds to you guys?Is that not true? They probably do and that's not familiar Okay, What we put you to is Where we've been talking to them as well and if we This would probably be mastery as a whole but then again like we're big on like not having schools in the principal pay so much So they could potentially fund the use of the tool for you.

**Christopher Ziemba**Okay So initially it's like sponsored kind of like kind of a test pilot and then it's like yeah Are we signing up long-term that sort of thing?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, yeah, exactly and the long-term whatever thing is like just something like, you know Our goal is really it doesn't come out of your pocket or the school budget Okay, you like we're I think the new bar thing is very highly likely Okay, it's not officially closed now.know you know that kind of stuff But anyways for now I'd love to just show you the tool and then you could use it right and then we're going to free to use right now and And all I ask is that if you continue give me a thought to be back is yeah I'll pull it up here So and then do you have any um Low inference notes by any chance on you.I don't think so to be honest. That's okay I'm showing you this here. Okay, let me pull up some of my own Okay, let's do this one.This is a third grade physical education teacher Okay, so here I went to e-val by swift score dark And send you this link after the call.essentially what it is, is I can drop my notes right here. I could type them in. I could also just drag and drop, right?I hit that, yeah. And then let's call it teacher. Let's call it Tess. Now, if I go down here and I click Generate Report, what it's going to do is it builds the evaluation for me right here.And each of these specific components, I'm going to be able to click into and see the feedback for. And it's going to give a score on wonderful.So again, this is Danielson. But if you're using the Play Lab, my guess is that you're isn't terribly different.And this is something that if we had the way we do it, is if we had you plus five other people with the mastery framework, we could put it together.we could do a custom build for you. OK, that's what I mean. That would kind of have to happen for me.

**Christopher Ziemba**use it. It's not. It's very different. And I mean, the probably lot of principles are the same, but they're super unique to our organization.So, interesting.

**Will Krasnow**So how is the play live be useful?

**Christopher Ziemba**They, they use, they said the standard, I don't know who did it, I guess, man, or they said the standards into mastery.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, super.

**Christopher Ziemba**I mean, it's totally aligned to our standards. I see, I see. Yeah, yeah, Interesting.

**Will Krasnow**So I guess before I go on, and then I do want to show you the rest. Then I think the move would be then for this, which is if I would gauge, because then I don't want to give you, I mean, I'll give you the tool, but I probably won't find much use of it.both ridiculous. So what would be interesting is I'll gauge if you're interested, if you're not interested, be honest, totally fine.If you help and your APs are interested, and then we're also, I think I'm meeting with Heather Shag at some point.Yeah, yeah. And if, and if her and hurry,

**Christopher Ziemba**these are interested then I then we could we could do how many how many schools do you want ideally for mastery again like five we would need five seats whether that's APs or principles to do okay you I'll get you five seat okay sweet well Heather will be one I know Heather really well I can get you three and the head of academics I'll get I'll start to like I think this will be really cool and I'm like totally sold on a platform like this in terms of helping us dramatically and so I will you know I'm not I'm only principal lowly principal but I will be my best I've been here in long time so I will like if that if that investment will help to align like let's figure it out one thousand percent I really for that and

**Will Krasnow**And then on my end, I'll do I'll talk to new baron charter school growth funds so that this is just okay for everyone yeah cool amazing all right to show you the rest of the platform.So I go here I have my scores that came in I can change those scores I disagree with it I want to move it I can click into a specific evaluation and I'm going to see my low inference notes okay on the side and then on the left I'm going to see a suggested summary so this the things that's like we actually have modified it a bit from the play lab so we'll always make it like performance analysis so what happened and was it good and ideally like a little focus on the positive it's kind of like you're your glows and then your growth path and this will lean into all the specific things we recommend the teacher do another thing that we have here is we have a generate teacher summary so what that's going to do is you mention so I'll show it.you mentioned it's helpful in the writing, the words, right? then teachers don't need all of this, you know, fluff all the time, or like just the words themselves is something that's helpful with these AI tools.What this just did is it turned that like multi-paragraph essentially essay about the teachers' performance in component 1A into one paragraph with the voice of a coach that's designed to be engaging for a teacher who's you know, not really be looking at it, but still can be memorable.Okay, yep, that's great. You could then copy this, put this into your, are you guys using our school or what data management?No, we have our own system.

**Christopher Ziemba**Okay, cool. It's like it's built within our organization.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, that's interesting because if it's built within y'all too, then that's something we could talk about integrating with as well.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, I mean that you're getting above my grade at this point, so.

**Will Krasnow**I don't think any promise says no, I mean, I will if it works like I will be a big cheerleader, but you know Yeah, you know You have a high-level summary here, right and you could talk to a chatbot about it and questions about it And then you could go back to your home page Here I am let me do any sign into a different account This So when I sign into an account And I can just create an account let's do So I go to this home page There aren't any populated ones hereSo, let's throw one more in. So, what other pages doing, and I just had to go to a different account because I kept out of my credits, we were messing around with the testing.But essentially, what that's going to do is it's going to show me all my teachers, and it's going to show them on little cards, and it's going to be the average score, the percent change over time, and then if I have defined a coaching focus for them.So, if I go back here, I didn't define the name, teacher name, teacher, I know school. And then I can define a coaching focus, and then allow that to generate a specific coaching report.So, the mastery charter schools, do you guys do like six week or eight week coaching classes?

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, for sure.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Sweet. And is that towards a like a specific framework that you guys use or just our instructional standards.

**Christopher Ziemba**So we don't use like a co gene framework. Say a lot of it's like built, the frameworks have been built internally, but it's aligned to our instructional standards, aligned to obviously starts with student outcomes, then we line teacher actions to those outcomes.Okay, got you.

**Will Krasnow**Super cool. So this is something we could also modify slightly for your needs as well. But if I see the unknown teacher, right?

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**And I click into them. This is the average of other scores, and then I could actually see their change over time over their different about it.that's cool.

**Christopher Ziemba**And then I could define a focus.

**Will Krasnow**So if I define focus, I could pick the domain I want to focus on, the subdomain, again, this is Daniels and stuff, but we could do this.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**mastery frameworks. I could go to TV. AI is going to suggest a couple more refined focuses. So I'm like, all right, formative assessment.It's like a wait. build and get to most bite size step and then implementation strategy so let's focus on enhancing student discourse and then it's going to take that drill into the specific thing and then generate this coaching report which will show as are here your glows here the strengths that the teacher had in this area right and here are the key growth areas right and specifically we're focusing on incorporating more discourse then if I scroll down here there's evidence there's impact and then series of action steps with an implementation plan for each okay with that implementation plan it's like weeks one to two and this is according to a multi-week coaching framework and then it's going to have smart goals like here at the end of the week we want the teacher to be here and then your next action step and then your next plan and all right this is three to four now hereand then so on and so forth. Yup. After that, you're gonna be able to view the tree of the teacher growth in progress and visualize how they've been growing over time.There's something at my door. Do you mind if I just- No, ahead. Yeah. Sorry about that.

**Christopher Ziemba**OK, no problem.

**Will Krasnow**They're showing my apartment, and I didn't know. So that's fun.

**Christopher Ziemba**That's interesting.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. OK, but anyways, you can map their growth over time, right? So we're focusing on 2B for this teacher.We only have that one focused on. And I can see how that maps into the whole teacher tree of growth.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yep. I could always go back.

**Will Krasnow**I see my reports. And then when I'm done, just mark it as complete. And go back to the page and create a new evaluation for a new teacher.Great.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, think our standards are much simpler.

**Will Krasnow**OK.

**Christopher Ziemba**I think it will be less complex, to be honest with you, but yeah, that looks awesome. OK. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**So yeah, I mean, tell me, and we could be totally honest. But like... Would this be something if considering mastery charter's framework, something that you would use?Yes.

**Christopher Ziemba**For sure.

**Will Krasnow**As I go into discussions with new valorant and charter school growth fund, mind just sharing little bit of like why or like what does it do that your current tooling doesn't do?

**Christopher Ziemba**I think makes the process more efficient, makes the process more exact, eliminates human error bias, and I think ultimately will produce a result that is significantly better than what we're producing on our own.And, I mean, I think the most important thing, it allows us to support teacher growth, not analyze teacher growth.think this doesn't really exist in our school, but there's a culture in most schools where the coach It's in the back of the computer and like, there's a lot of like, let's think about instruction versus let's impact instruction, right?And let's eliminate that think about, right? And that's like, that's, that's my, you know, that's my take. I love it.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. And for the record, that is the mission of what we're after, right? it is. Right? I mean, there's one thing which is making it easier, right, which is true.But we make it easier for what? And it's so that you have the time and the tools to then think about the growth of the teacher and lean into those things, which, as I understand, it has been like, just a super hard thing to do, like, without the data without, like, if you don't know and can't see how they're, they're doing evaluation to evaluation, I could imagine.

**Christopher Ziemba**I'll be honest, this is the future in all capacities. we are still behind, feel like, or like, I don't know if we're like, I don't know relative to other schools, but like, there's so much.opportunity to like, when I think about teacher planning, teacher grading, like, there's so much opportunity to just like automate this, right?Right. you know, obviously with human input, like, um, like, it up an eye on it, there's so much opportunity to sort of make all of this far more efficient to really keep our focus on instruction and kids, right?When we talk about teacher burnout, right? It's like, it's a lot of this stuff, right? It's like, that's something that you're creating.It's all this stuff we asked them to do that could be easier and better, right? Right.

**Will Krasnow**And you could correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm not an educator, but from the conversations I've heard, the reasons people have gotten into education aren't to do grading papers or creating Daniel's or whatever evaluations.It's probably to work with people in person, right? Yeah, to be in classrooms and like, okay, this is your next step.

**Christopher Ziemba**Let's work with you to ensure that that thing can happen, right?

**Will Krasnow**Right. So yeah, I'm completely on board.

**Christopher Ziemba**And I feel like I have the capacity now to sort of think about it and think about how we integrate and just really excited about it.Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. I'm meeting with Matt Leader today. So I'll tell you. he messaged me this morning. was like, Chris is a great guy.You're going to have fun.

**Christopher Ziemba**I swear to God. And he does do that with all of I think, I think, honestly, my level and investment with that and this has not been great because we just had other priorities.think I truly am in a place to like, OK. And I think the playoff staff really was compelling to me, for sure, more so than what I've experienced in the US.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. You're OK. That's exciting to hear. So how about this? If you could find five names. OK. seats of like these are the people at you know it could be people from your school could be cool from others within the charter Master charter then I will Continue this combo and I and I will keep you.I'll give it. I'll get everyone seats and you all can use it Again, that's probably not super relevant until we build out the specific thing and then the other thing I was gonna ask is can I have that the framework you guys are using yeah Yeah, I'll send your standards.Yeah, I'll just send it your email Do that the next hours that okay totally fun. Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, I think what you're gonna find is like yeah It's you know since far more complex.

**Will Krasnow**There are definitely is the spirit here, but like It's not rocket science for sure right Amazing so yeah, if you send the framework the five names I will keep you in the loop and how the discussions go through bar and again super optimistic about that oneAnd then and also the charter school growth fund and see see what that all looks like, but then going to them being like, hey, know, Chris principal loves tool wants us to integrate it and we're ready to build it.

**Christopher Ziemba**I think is it better to like have former new bar for colors like we have a bunch of principles who've done new bar is that connection helpful in any way that is helpful.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, that is that is preferred.

**Christopher Ziemba**Yeah, I have, okay, I have some people in mind that already connected, so I'll start with them. Okay, amazing.Awesome.

**Will Krasnow**Keeping the list. Oh, oh, the one final thing is no worries if you're not comfortable with this, but I happen to be pretty directed and formal.Could I take your number and just you a text. Yeah. And then I'm just better with numbers than I am email.No, that's fine.

**Christopher Ziemba**Two, seven, one, four, three, four, six, nine.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. And I'm just going to shoot you text. it's will, teacher, evaluation guy. Okay, awesome. Anything else that I can do to help you out?

**Christopher Ziemba**Nope, look forward to the partnership.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing, amazing. Well, keep me in the lotta and have a great Friday. You too, too. Thanks, Chris.

**Christopher Ziemba**Bye.

Catering it's not you know, it's not the snow that closes school. What does you know, right?

**Will Krasnow**Well, you guys have them off Days recently, right?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, like I just want a four-day week every week. That's what I would like I mean if we could just Just just keep it going.

**Will Krasnow**Yes Yeah, but Yeah, okay Think well again, thanks for hopping on Um Before jumping in how can you just tell me how do you know my kelly is it from new bar?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, yeah, it's nice And um as soon as as soon as he started this, you know going down the road of the daniel sin You know AI was like, please please please because it um Yeah, it's exhausting to do the things To do the things it is exhausting.

**Will Krasnow**That's what I've kept on hearing Um, have you had a chance to use the initial AI in your sin?Email generator for the play lab. Yes, both both sweet Are you still using them?

**Susan Thompson**Every time I go in, yes. Because, and I think I, my assistant principal, I keep telling them, do this, do this.feel like it gets close enough to what I would need. And then I just modify based on, you know, if I saw something that AI didn't see.Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**OK, super cool. And before doing, before, let's say the tool, the AI tool, so how long would it take you to transfer from low inference notes to an evaluation?

**Susan Thompson**So I kind of have a cryptic answer to that. My low inference notes, I'm an incredibly fast typeer. what I do is my low inference notes are time stamped and I have the entire dialogue.Nice. but my assistant principals, their role is to cover me by being in classes. So they're doing four or five a week and they, I have five of them.Well four of them do four or five a week and one of them does two and then I try and get in.

**Will Krasnow**Nice, how many APs do you have? guess. have five. You're five. So how many students or teachers are at your school?

**Susan Thompson**So we have a hundred, 42 on the sheet. So that's a teacher and counselors. So we have 18, 20 kids and lots of teachers and counselors and etc.Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Amazing. And then final question before I'll give you context about everything that we're doing. You're using Play a Lot.It's been helpful, right? Oh yeah. And so how long does it take to turn to create an evaluation now that you have to have that?

**Susan Thompson**I think it brings it down to 15, right, because, you know, maybe 10 to 15, because it generates, I look, I say, okay, I wouldn't have worded it that way.I would word it this way so that they don't ever know that it's coming from, but than that, yeah, it makes it a lot quicker, like, instead of feeling like I could get one or two done in an hour, I'm able to get done in half an hour and then move on and start looking at what the next steps are and how I'm going to support the teacher.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. And I lied. There's one more question I forgot to ask. So when you're giving an evaluation, do you have any process for tracking the teacher's growth over time?

**Susan Thompson**So you're quite hard to do.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Susan Thompson**No, I mean, basically I just look at score score and then, you know, what I ask them to work on, and then I go back looking atyou see if they're working on what they said they were working on or what I suggested.

**Will Krasnow**Cool. Okay. thank you so much for answering those questions and hopefully they'll be clear why they're relevant here in about a second.So the context here is I met Matt Kelly about a year ago. I'm the founder of C.O. SWIFT-SCORE. We build AI technology for educators just like yourself.He and I have been talking about exactly the tools that you've been using which are the you know what the AI finishing generator, the email generator and then the play lab.And we are working together now. He's at the C.O. of independent charter schools. He passed the tool long to SWIFT-SCORE and our team and then stayed on as a advisor thought partner of ours.And we are building out a professional grade version of the tool. We launched initially with a couple of principles in Philla SC and now we are bringing a couple to 20 to 30 and they're APs.like yourself, we are focusing primarily on new Bauer Fellows and what this looks like is we're getting them set up, giving them access to the only ask that we get some feedback, know, and thoughts along the way.And then the ultimate goal is by the end, you know, about an about a month or so to work with the New Bauer Foundation and Penn Graduate School of Education and actually convene a group of these principles together, just like yourself, who are using the tool and get, you know, a professor or a postdoc to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool.and that new power to fund and sponsor the use of it for all of the all. So what I would love to do today is show you the tool, get your thoughts.My hope is we could do really two things. One is that 15 minutes could go down to like five, which hopefully could add it up, you know, a significant amount of time, and I'll show you how and why we do that.And then the second is help you with a task that I understand is very difficult, which is tracking teacher progress and trying to get into analytics that are little bit beyond score and towards more specific coaching focus, towards mapping the informals, towards coming up with next steps for coaching plans.this is something that if you like, again, happy to just totally give it to you, and then also to your APs as well.were interested in using the tool. How does that all sound? Sweet. Do you have any low inference notes on you that you are interested in in using any what low inference notes?Sure, let me cut and paste them into the chat work or it's great It's an informal but That's really fun and actually, you know, it's often that I would expect that you'd use this tool for your informals as well Right amazing Okay, that's really meaty but Fine, I think it should be let's seeAs long as it's not, like, this is pretty good. Cool. OK, so I will show you it. And then after I show it to you, I could get you set up on it the way that works here.And you can see my screen. OK, sweet. So if you go to eval by swiffscore.com, take you to this page where essentially you can either drag and drop PDFs or your low pretense or just type them in.And I'm going to copy and paste your notes here. And literally, all I'm going to do is click Generate Report.Now, this is on a testing site, so the scores might be slightly too generous because we're trying things out.But I'll send you the actual non-testing site. What it's going to do is it's going to show the four different domains.Each of the specific criteria that are relevant to you. and then the average Danielson score. There's also going to be a summary AI generated about generally what happened with this teacher.For each specific component, you're gonna be able to click into it and see how it did specific feedback. So here you're gonna see the score, it got a 2.2 out of four for this teacher and you have this high level summary.You'll like 20 seconds just to read that there.

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, well, I used this for some of my formals in January. You used this tool?

**Will Krasnow**I did. Nice.

**Susan Thompson**It's nice.

**Will Krasnow**You used this, how did you get access to this tool in January? Matt?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, he shared it with a few of us because he knew we were gonna pick it up and do it.Okay, sweet, how did it go?

**Will Krasnow**I think it went really well to what I said before.

**Susan Thompson**It was, it was, it's important for me to, like... go through and reword some things, just the way I speak and connect.But otherwise, it was pretty dead on. And one of the benefits, I'll be very honest with you, is that if somebody came back to me, if a teacher was like, it feels like you gave me a lower score than not, I have in my thinking that you're a bad person, or because I don't like you, this is literally like, this is the tool I use.I did have one teacher like, I don't understand that, I was like, well, and I was able to like, very, I more time being able to link what the output was from Swift score to what I've seen daily, right?Should be able to say, no, this is not, this is not a made up thing. This is, you know, so yeah, I think it's incredibly valuable in that way.

**Will Krasnow**So I'm so glad I'm so glad I had no idea that you're already using so you don't need me to explain explain it Great, and I'm glad so because you're saying like oh, it's nice that it's stored here that you can return to it Especially when you're having that conversation with it.Mm-hmm. That's cool. Um, did you As you had you saw that you could like change the score right and click into everything My question to you is this Did you have a chance to check out the coaching suite?I?

**Susan Thompson**Looked at it, but you know, I didn't necessarily spend a lot of time in it again I'm in this situation where I just don't I mean I wish I were a better instructional leader But it's really hard given all the other gobbley book that happens in company.Yes. I'm sure I'm sure So would you expect to use the coaching suite because if so I chose you but if you expect not to I don't I mean, I think the interest yes I would like to but I would what I'd like to do and I think this is where you know I would like to do it with my APlike what I don't want is that like I have the tool that nobody else does because they spend a lot more time in the rooms with the teachers than I do.

**Will Krasnow**Right and I love that and one of the things that we're working on and this will take a little bit of time but should be coming within a few weeks is our AP portal so that we design so currently what we could do is we get your AP set up all on their own account so they'll have you know their different progress of teachers whatever but ideally it's synced up to the teachers that you have and the other and you can see them all see yeah exactly right that's common but for now I would happily show this to your APs and then also give them the link and the stuff and and I because you're a new power fellow as well like we can totally include your APs as part of this program and have them have seats in this whole you know for use the tool pen GSE thing that we were we were talking about yeah awesomeOkay, sweet. Can I have, okay, a couple of things. Can I just take the names and emails of those APs?Sure.

**Susan Thompson**Let me just drop in and chat because it's kind of a pain in the glutes.

**Will Krasnow**And you said you use this for some formals in January, right? Any feedback or thoughts about how it went beyond what you first used?

**Susan Thompson**One of the feedbacks, so I am responsible, based on my background, I'm responsible for all of the low-inc classrooms.So those are the special education classrooms. Understood. And I think one of the benefits of what I do, I'm just going to do these individuals because otherwise it gets weird.One of the things that I do is I preface, like, in the before I plug in my low-invergence notes, I say.

**Will Krasnow**I have the time here now, after you take your AP names, we actually just built out, we just edited the AI for special education and just taking this here, evaluations, but we haven't really tested it much.So I don't know how useful it will be.

**Susan Thompson**Back in the last case.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, can we try it out right now? I'm really curious. Do you have any from a note on Princeton from one of those classes?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, let me, let me go, fine. Here we go. This is a whole full class, so I'm going to...Perfect. And again, I type everything, so it's quite... That's good.

**Will Krasnow**I will say, like... Or that is typed, the better it does. And that's just because like, I mean, you use it, but what we found is that times where it's not as accurate as just because the evaluator was like, oh, yeah, didn't include that.

**Susan Thompson**Let me see, you know what? Let me do it this way. Let me share the document with you. What's your address?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, will at Swift score. So S-W-I-F-T-S-C dot org.

**Susan Thompson**OK, I just made you an editor. Don't mess with it because this going to be somebody's going to try and say I was targeting her, but she's absolutely awful.OK. Because it wouldn't let me put the whole narrative in the chat. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, wow. Yeah, you are a fast diaper. That's incredible. Yeah, let's see how it does. I'm really curious if it will do similar andTo be honest with me too, because I want to. This is just just not what goes at it. So I throw it in here.This is all of your stuff. Really robust. Let's generate this report. Let's see how it goes. And so you used it for your.I'm sorry. Formals in January, right? Now. Now. Is there a reason you didn't use it for informals afterwards? Oh, in transparency, I.

**Susan Thompson**Haven't gotten into the classrooms as much as I wanted to. I was going to try. So I had. I had to schedule this week because I knew I had this meeting.One person was out and the other one was on a community based trip. And I was like, oh, well, I'm not going to find you teaching today.So and then everything wrapped around my schedule was just ridiculous. Cool. But I would in transparency, I would use it.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**That's great.

**Susan Thompson**And I'm trying to push my APs to use it as well, because it's still in testing, so you guys haven't figured out that we've been using it.Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Will Krasnow**I'm glad. So, for your APs, while this is loading, I'd be happy to meet with all of them and show the tool.Like, I could come in and at this time, I'll make sure I don't have any scheduling conflicts. I could come in and sit with your various APs and just get them all set up.Would that be useful?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, yeah, I think it would. And I, because I'm constantly trying to take work away from them, like one of them today tried to argue with me.I was like, no, no, no, I'm taking that away from you. She's like, oh, Well, I'm like, no, we, we meet every Monday from eight to nine 30, but I could always extend it because we have business business, but I could always.Okay, so they're all busy, and then what is this one? It is busy. says private, but I think we can get white or somebody else with some of them doing.I think we can do it. Let's say nine in case two of my APs have something scheduled after our meeting, but I think if we say nine, we should be able to fit it in.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet. Okay, so I am sending you an invite here, and then we can share that with them. Okay.

**Susan Thompson**In March six at nine.

**Will Krasnow**Sounds good.

**Susan Thompson**Perfect.

**Will Krasnow**Great. Oh, I also have their name so I can throw them on there too. Okay, let's take a I've got two across.Yeah, I think.

**Susan Thompson**No, I mean, this kind of is in line with what I found, right, because, you know, our score. I mean, what was, what was her overall score?Let me go back and then look at that. She ended up getting, um, I think she got, I don't know who was higher than a one, which is what this holds up to be, um, because even her communication with families is just non-existent.And I don't know how you have, you know, children who are intellectually disabled and you're not actually communicating with the families like it's, yeah, that's just not today.had a back and forth email with the special ed coordinator, she's like, yeah, I can't find the number for the father.I was like, you've had this kid in your class all year long and you can't find the number.

**Will Krasnow**What?

**Susan Thompson**Um, yeah, but she'll tell you she's his best teacher, that's how they will.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Susan Thompson**So let me go into where my component might have been different. So opening the view, formal observation. OK. view, formal observation.OK. OK. So I rated her a 0 for setting instructional outcomes. Which one is that? It's 1c. Oh, it's the one I'm on.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. And the performance analysis or?

**Susan Thompson**So what it became, let me look back. wrote in there because I did have to make some adjustments. I listed that there wasn't clear alignment with the activities and students weren't doing the activities that were set so she's what she did what she said maybe maybe what I didn't do with this one that I've done with other ones is I've put in the pre observation and when I put in the pre observation that helps with what the instructional outcomes are sure yeah but she had said this is what kids are gonna do kids are going to we're going to like call and response and children are going to say this but not a single piece out of any of the children there was no call and response I was like well what's the goal we know that call and response actually helps kids learn you know you matter so I was just looking at thatOne E, I had the same score, two B, I had the same score, two C, I had the same score, two D, three A, same score.Three B, same score, three C, same score. Yeah, so it was just in that one area. Cool, so mostly it was pretty spot on.Yeah. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Nice.

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, my fear with a specialized special education one is the idea that I don't, I'm like very much like the standards are here.Like, let's not think that when a kid gets something wrong, that it's bad. It's how we take when a child gets something wrong and reengage them.but overall, it was just that. That one difference for mine.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Susan Thompson**Nice.

**Will Krasnow**Great. That's great to hear. Okay. Anything else that you want to cover from my understanding next steps here is March 6th.I'm there at your school with your APs. And we'll show them the tool also by then. And we'll have that's a little ways from now, which is cool too, because I don't know if we could squeeze in the AP portal by then.We'll try, but there's certainly been new stuff coming on the way so we could talk about all that. And then are you interested?You and your APs have taken part in this new Bauer PEN GSE group. Yeah. Okay. be like, you know, it's meant to be easy and save you time, right?it'd be like, you know, once a month at most. Hopefully, we can get food and make it look a fun thing with all the principles and things.I will keep you posted about how that goes. still talking to new power, our PMGSE is fully committed to it, so that will just take some time as things do.

**Susan Thompson**I've worked in both places, so yes. You worked for... Well, I didn't work for Penn. I went there, undergrad, masters, and just finished my doctorate.Nice.

**Will Krasnow**Congrats. Wait, but you worked for NuBout? No, I didn't work for NuBout.

**Susan Thompson**just know the things are slow, so whenever you integrate all of those... It's a lot. You're like, can we just get this done, and you're like them.I think the biggest sell for you would be... On your end, the biggest sell would be that just if you are able to anonymize it as much as possible and keep it safe, right?So, I think about it that way. like all of my low inference notes, I change and make sure I take out every child's name.call the teacher becomes teacher, right? It's like. Yeah, that's a great point.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, and one of the things that we're doing is we're building out the ability for like, you wouldn't even have to do that.We would automatically do it to make sure it doesn't get sent in, like stuff like that. Exactly, yeah. Okay, it's a great point.Cool, great. Please, oh, fine thing. And no worries if you're not comfortable with this, but I happen to be very direct and I'm much better over.I'm pretty good on email, I'm great on text. Okay. Would it be cool if I just took your number and you could shoot me in text if anything comes up?Yeah, What is your name?

**Susan Thompson**26-7-254-3-0-4-7.

**Will Krasnow**3-0-4-7, I'm gonna just shoot you text. Okay, it will. So, yeah, if anything comes up or you have questions or thoughts or whatever or APs, just let me know and I will keep you in the loop and then I'll see you at the very least on March 6th.Fantastic.

**Susan Thompson**good. All right. Thanks so much.

**Will Krasnow**I'll tell Matt that we met up.

**Susan Thompson**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**See you later, Will.

**Susan Thompson**Have a great day.

Catering it's not you know, it's not the snow that closes school. What does you know, right?

**Will Krasnow**Well, you guys have them off Days recently, right?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, like I just want a four-day week every week. That's what I would like I mean if we could just Just just keep it going.

**Will Krasnow**Yes Yeah, but Yeah, okay Think well again, thanks for hopping on Um Before jumping in how can you just tell me how do you know my kelly is it from new bar?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, yeah, it's nice And um as soon as as soon as he started this, you know going down the road of the daniel sin You know AI was like, please please please because it um Yeah, it's exhausting to do the things To do the things it is exhausting.

**Will Krasnow**That's what I've kept on hearing Um, have you had a chance to use the initial AI in your sin?Email generator for the play lab. Yes, both both sweet Are you still using them?

**Susan Thompson**Every time I go in, yes. Because, and I think I, my assistant principal, I keep telling them, do this, do this.feel like it gets close enough to what I would need. And then I just modify based on, you know, if I saw something that AI didn't see.Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**OK, super cool. And before doing, before, let's say the tool, the AI tool, so how long would it take you to transfer from low inference notes to an evaluation?

**Susan Thompson**So I kind of have a cryptic answer to that. My low inference notes, I'm an incredibly fast typeer. what I do is my low inference notes are time stamped and I have the entire dialogue.Nice. but my assistant principals, their role is to cover me by being in classes. So they're doing four or five a week and they, I have five of them.Well four of them do four or five a week and one of them does two and then I try and get in.

**Will Krasnow**Nice, how many APs do you have? guess. have five. You're five. So how many students or teachers are at your school?

**Susan Thompson**So we have a hundred, 42 on the sheet. So that's a teacher and counselors. So we have 18, 20 kids and lots of teachers and counselors and etc.Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Amazing. And then final question before I'll give you context about everything that we're doing. You're using Play a Lot.It's been helpful, right? Oh yeah. And so how long does it take to turn to create an evaluation now that you have to have that?

**Susan Thompson**I think it brings it down to 15, right, because, you know, maybe 10 to 15, because it generates, I look, I say, okay, I wouldn't have worded it that way.I would word it this way so that they don't ever know that it's coming from, but than that, yeah, it makes it a lot quicker, like, instead of feeling like I could get one or two done in an hour, I'm able to get done in half an hour and then move on and start looking at what the next steps are and how I'm going to support the teacher.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. And I lied. There's one more question I forgot to ask. So when you're giving an evaluation, do you have any process for tracking the teacher's growth over time?

**Susan Thompson**So you're quite hard to do.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Susan Thompson**No, I mean, basically I just look at score score and then, you know, what I ask them to work on, and then I go back looking atyou see if they're working on what they said they were working on or what I suggested.

**Will Krasnow**Cool. Okay. thank you so much for answering those questions and hopefully they'll be clear why they're relevant here in about a second.So the context here is I met Matt Kelly about a year ago. I'm the founder of C.O. SWIFT-SCORE. We build AI technology for educators just like yourself.He and I have been talking about exactly the tools that you've been using which are the you know what the AI finishing generator, the email generator and then the play lab.And we are working together now. He's at the C.O. of independent charter schools. He passed the tool long to SWIFT-SCORE and our team and then stayed on as a advisor thought partner of ours.And we are building out a professional grade version of the tool. We launched initially with a couple of principles in Philla SC and now we are bringing a couple to 20 to 30 and they're APs.like yourself, we are focusing primarily on new Bauer Fellows and what this looks like is we're getting them set up, giving them access to the only ask that we get some feedback, know, and thoughts along the way.And then the ultimate goal is by the end, you know, about an about a month or so to work with the New Bauer Foundation and Penn Graduate School of Education and actually convene a group of these principles together, just like yourself, who are using the tool and get, you know, a professor or a postdoc to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool.and that new power to fund and sponsor the use of it for all of the all. So what I would love to do today is show you the tool, get your thoughts.My hope is we could do really two things. One is that 15 minutes could go down to like five, which hopefully could add it up, you know, a significant amount of time, and I'll show you how and why we do that.And then the second is help you with a task that I understand is very difficult, which is tracking teacher progress and trying to get into analytics that are little bit beyond score and towards more specific coaching focus, towards mapping the informals, towards coming up with next steps for coaching plans.this is something that if you like, again, happy to just totally give it to you, and then also to your APs as well.were interested in using the tool. How does that all sound? Sweet. Do you have any low inference notes on you that you are interested in in using any what low inference notes?Sure, let me cut and paste them into the chat work or it's great It's an informal but That's really fun and actually, you know, it's often that I would expect that you'd use this tool for your informals as well Right amazing Okay, that's really meaty but Fine, I think it should be let's seeAs long as it's not, like, this is pretty good. Cool. OK, so I will show you it. And then after I show it to you, I could get you set up on it the way that works here.And you can see my screen. OK, sweet. So if you go to eval by swiffscore.com, take you to this page where essentially you can either drag and drop PDFs or your low pretense or just type them in.And I'm going to copy and paste your notes here. And literally, all I'm going to do is click Generate Report.Now, this is on a testing site, so the scores might be slightly too generous because we're trying things out.But I'll send you the actual non-testing site. What it's going to do is it's going to show the four different domains.Each of the specific criteria that are relevant to you. and then the average Danielson score. There's also going to be a summary AI generated about generally what happened with this teacher.For each specific component, you're gonna be able to click into it and see how it did specific feedback. So here you're gonna see the score, it got a 2.2 out of four for this teacher and you have this high level summary.You'll like 20 seconds just to read that there.

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, well, I used this for some of my formals in January. You used this tool?

**Will Krasnow**I did. Nice.

**Susan Thompson**It's nice.

**Will Krasnow**You used this, how did you get access to this tool in January? Matt?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, he shared it with a few of us because he knew we were gonna pick it up and do it.Okay, sweet, how did it go?

**Will Krasnow**I think it went really well to what I said before.

**Susan Thompson**It was, it was, it's important for me to, like... go through and reword some things, just the way I speak and connect.But otherwise, it was pretty dead on. And one of the benefits, I'll be very honest with you, is that if somebody came back to me, if a teacher was like, it feels like you gave me a lower score than not, I have in my thinking that you're a bad person, or because I don't like you, this is literally like, this is the tool I use.I did have one teacher like, I don't understand that, I was like, well, and I was able to like, very, I more time being able to link what the output was from Swift score to what I've seen daily, right?Should be able to say, no, this is not, this is not a made up thing. This is, you know, so yeah, I think it's incredibly valuable in that way.

**Will Krasnow**So I'm so glad I'm so glad I had no idea that you're already using so you don't need me to explain explain it Great, and I'm glad so because you're saying like oh, it's nice that it's stored here that you can return to it Especially when you're having that conversation with it.Mm-hmm. That's cool. Um, did you As you had you saw that you could like change the score right and click into everything My question to you is this Did you have a chance to check out the coaching suite?I?

**Susan Thompson**Looked at it, but you know, I didn't necessarily spend a lot of time in it again I'm in this situation where I just don't I mean I wish I were a better instructional leader But it's really hard given all the other gobbley book that happens in company.Yes. I'm sure I'm sure So would you expect to use the coaching suite because if so I chose you but if you expect not to I don't I mean, I think the interest yes I would like to but I would what I'd like to do and I think this is where you know I would like to do it with my APlike what I don't want is that like I have the tool that nobody else does because they spend a lot more time in the rooms with the teachers than I do.

**Will Krasnow**Right and I love that and one of the things that we're working on and this will take a little bit of time but should be coming within a few weeks is our AP portal so that we design so currently what we could do is we get your AP set up all on their own account so they'll have you know their different progress of teachers whatever but ideally it's synced up to the teachers that you have and the other and you can see them all see yeah exactly right that's common but for now I would happily show this to your APs and then also give them the link and the stuff and and I because you're a new power fellow as well like we can totally include your APs as part of this program and have them have seats in this whole you know for use the tool pen GSE thing that we were we were talking about yeah awesomeOkay, sweet. Can I have, okay, a couple of things. Can I just take the names and emails of those APs?Sure.

**Susan Thompson**Let me just drop in and chat because it's kind of a pain in the glutes.

**Will Krasnow**And you said you use this for some formals in January, right? Any feedback or thoughts about how it went beyond what you first used?

**Susan Thompson**One of the feedbacks, so I am responsible, based on my background, I'm responsible for all of the low-inc classrooms.So those are the special education classrooms. Understood. And I think one of the benefits of what I do, I'm just going to do these individuals because otherwise it gets weird.One of the things that I do is I preface, like, in the before I plug in my low-invergence notes, I say.

**Will Krasnow**I have the time here now, after you take your AP names, we actually just built out, we just edited the AI for special education and just taking this here, evaluations, but we haven't really tested it much.So I don't know how useful it will be.

**Susan Thompson**Back in the last case.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, can we try it out right now? I'm really curious. Do you have any from a note on Princeton from one of those classes?

**Susan Thompson**Yeah, let me, let me go, fine. Here we go. This is a whole full class, so I'm going to...Perfect. And again, I type everything, so it's quite... That's good.

**Will Krasnow**I will say, like... Or that is typed, the better it does. And that's just because like, I mean, you use it, but what we found is that times where it's not as accurate as just because the evaluator was like, oh, yeah, didn't include that.

**Susan Thompson**Let me see, you know what? Let me do it this way. Let me share the document with you. What's your address?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, will at Swift score. So S-W-I-F-T-S-C dot org.

**Susan Thompson**OK, I just made you an editor. Don't mess with it because this going to be somebody's going to try and say I was targeting her, but she's absolutely awful.OK. Because it wouldn't let me put the whole narrative in the chat. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, wow. Yeah, you are a fast diaper. That's incredible. Yeah, let's see how it does. I'm really curious if it will do similar andTo be honest with me too, because I want to. This is just just not what goes at it. So I throw it in here.This is all of your stuff. Really robust. Let's generate this report. Let's see how it goes. And so you used it for your.I'm sorry. Formals in January, right? Now. Now. Is there a reason you didn't use it for informals afterwards? Oh, in transparency, I.

**Susan Thompson**Haven't gotten into the classrooms as much as I wanted to. I was going to try. So I had. I had to schedule this week because I knew I had this meeting.One person was out and the other one was on a community based trip. And I was like, oh, well, I'm not going to find you teaching today.So and then everything wrapped around my schedule was just ridiculous. Cool. But I would in transparency, I would use it.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**That's great.

**Susan Thompson**And I'm trying to push my APs to use it as well, because it's still in testing, so you guys haven't figured out that we've been using it.Yeah, yeah, exactly.

She's like, oh, Well, I'm like, no, we, we meet every Monday from eight to nine 30, but I could always extend it because we have business business, but I could always.Okay, so they're all busy, and then what is this one? It is busy. says private, but I think we can get white or somebody else with some of them doing.I think we can do it. Let's say nine in case two of my APs have something scheduled after our meeting, but I think if we say nine, we should be able to fit it in.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet. Okay, so I am sending you an invite here, and then we can share that with them. Okay.

**Susan Thompson**In March six at nine.

**Will Krasnow**Sounds good.

**Susan Thompson**Perfect.

**Will Krasnow**Great. Oh, I also have their name so I can throw them on there too. Okay, let's take a I've got two across.Yeah, I think.

**Will Krasnow**What?

**Susan Thompson**Um, yeah, but she'll tell you she's his best teacher, that's how they will.

**Susan Thompson**good. All right. Thanks so much.

**Will Krasnow**I'll tell Matt that we met up.

**Susan Thompson**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**See you later, Will.

Good morning.

**Sharda Flores**Will?

**Will Krasnow**Yes, that is good.

**Christopher Lothian**So, I feel liberty of inviting my colleague principal to the meeting.

**Sharda Flores**Nice to meet you. Good morning. Thank you so much for this Once I heard of it, was like, yeah, the student.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, amazing, amazing. Yeah, I'm super excited to show you guys what we got. And before jumping in, you guys are in New York, right?

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, New York City, yes.

**Will Krasnow**New York City. And you guys, how many teachers are at your school?

**Sharda Flores**Too many.

**Christopher Lothian**I have approximately 39 classroom teachers.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, wow. 39.

**Sharda Flores**I have 35 classroom teachers and about 12 classroom teachers as well.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, and you guys split your teacher. We can't believe it.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, it's the Assistant Principles, yes.

**Christopher Lothian**OK, cool.

**Will Krasnow**And when you do evaluations, framework do you base it on? Are you guys using Danielson? Yes.

**Christopher Lothian**OK, sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Perfect. makes everything much, much easier. And generally, how long does it take you to create evaluations? Let's say just for one, you have a lot of friends notes, and you want to convert it to one evaluation.Yeah.

**Christopher Lothian**It's obviously probably like, I would say, for me, probably two hours plus. Right.

**Will Krasnow**Wow. In the straight thing.

**Sharda Flores**But we can never do that.

**Christopher Lothian**Exactly.

**Sharda Flores**That's the problem.

**Christopher Lothian**Right. the issue.

**Will Krasnow**Interruptions and what have you. OK, that makes sense. And now how many evaluations are you creating a week?

**Christopher Lothian**My requirement for my APS is to do two a week. Two a week.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, very similar. So it ranges, right?

**Sharda Flores**Because we start off with this is the intent, but it sometimes we make our goal of a minus three, and then sometimes we don't.And then they also do walk them in between, which is not advanced, but it's aligned to what the progress should look like when they do go into it.Right, right. Understood.

**Will Krasnow**And do you guys spend time creating like four or six or eight week coaching plans in addition to evaluations?

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, we have our action plans, uh, cycles that we do create with individual teachers. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**And is that a few times a week, I'm sorry, a few times a year or is it one week or how often if you have to guess.

**Christopher Lothian**It depends on the teacher, teachers have like cycles that could last, typically my cycles are like four to six weeks.And if it's a new teacher, yeah.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah. Cool. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**And then my one final question. is. So you create an evaluation or you create a let's check with the evaluation.Are you storing that in a system? Are you guys using power school or front-line or like advanced?

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, the observations are stored in advanced but the walkthroughs and the other things are stored on like Google Docs or...Right, right.

**Will Krasnow**That's perfect. And then are you guys using any other tech or non-tech or anything that you want to mention about the process?

**Christopher Lothian**I mean we have been messing around with like AI like just chat GPT with like yeah I was having gone.I mean it's helpful for me it's helpful especially times when I get stuck with like just kind of wording things or just thinking of like different strategies for next steps so things like that.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah, I think it's great for like wording when you can't find the like those those key, you know, which is great, but you still I find myself still having to input the image of the opposition and talk and transfer it over and then we thesis.So it's working to give you the next steps and whatever, but it's just too much of the transferring back and forth that sometimes that just is I'll just write it right.Right. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Christopher Lothian**this will be a little insight is why I think principal floor to do totally different ways. I think if I correct me if I'm wrong, I think she types her observations as she's doing her low inference notes are typed.Yeah, I don't like I write I can't type fast. So yeah, I have to transfer my notes, copy my notes and type in my notes.Yeah, another step.

**Will Krasnow**Got you. Okay, cool. And we're coming out soon with a version where we can just accept and written. So that might be a line.One of our advisors is guy by the name of Matt Kelly and he's also in Philadelphia and he was a principal for seven years, he was a teacher for seven years, and then he coached principals for seven years.And when he was coaching principals, he found more or less the same story that you guys said in like maybe same text, different font, which was observations take forever.And they are frustrating and important part of my job, but it's like it is filled with just a ton of tasks that aren't super fun to do and that take me away from other important things.And so what we ended up doing is we messed around with chat GPT just like y'all did and found a somewhat similar thing, which like A, chat GPT is good.B, some of the feedback and responses are okay, could be improved a little bit and then see the whole transfer thing is ridiculous.So what we did and I'm. I'm to show you this now, is we created a portal, a tool, it's called Evow, and you upload your launch, for instance, you can create a Danielson score, generate feedback for each component.So if you're like, all right, want to drill into 3C, 2A, 1B, you can click into that, see the feedback, edit it if you see fit, it's all stored in this one system, and then because it's all stored, you can track your teacher progress over time.So it's like, oh, know, we're doing a coaching focus of 3C, you know, my next evaluation showed that 3C went down, like what happened there, and then maybe AI can come up with a suggestion about like, here are the actionable steps we recommend you take.At the end of the day, y'all are the instructional leaders of the building, and I can't do everything, this tool can't do everything, but it is my hope, and I'll show you to you, and you'll tell me what you think.that it can help you do the things you do best. Well, I'm not sure if I missed this part.

**Sharda Flores**Well, I'll put traffic today, of course. Is it, is it, is it, does it connect with advance or does it live outside?

**Will Krasnow**So it currently lives outside. If we were to use work with like, and again, we're super new, we're really primarily working with principles in Philadelphia and most of them use Power School.But even with them, our Power School integration isn't up yet. it would be, and I'll show you pretty easy to copy and paste it into it.And then if, you know, y'all were using the tool a lot and like, you know, there were others from your district and whatever, we'd be like, all right, let's build an integration.So it just automatically shoots over to advance. Okay.

**Sharda Flores**So good question. And I'll show you it.

**Will Krasnow**If you're like, yeah, you know what? It's still a lot of switching. My hope is it's not.

**Sharda Flores**It's easy to copy and paste senators to have to sit there and spend mind-boggling all the time.

**Will Krasnow**Yes, that's the goal. It's interesting. So my question is, do any of y'all have or me, Charda, because you might have typed loan-for-it-snotes?Do you have any that you? We can do it on the call right here. Any like that, are you waiting to turn into an evaluation?No, I just have to, know, I probably have my.

**Sharda Flores**So what I do is I have like this one Google form, and also stamps a time when I go in.Nice. And I'll go into history and I'll just check the time frame, because I just, you know, so that's the nice part about that.Let me see what I have on me right now. I do have a couple of things from the previous.Like I said, as they're talking, I'm just taking notes. And then I take that and I code it. Good.I start transferring them as they see. Yeah, that's exactly how we're designed to do it.

**Will Krasnow**Or we can take like, you know, it's going to be ugly. They could be mistyled. should they could be, you know, they're, they're so like that's good.That's good. All right.

**Sharda Flores**drop in the chat. All right. I'll just drop a couple of things that I saw.

**Will Krasnow**or, you know what, actually, if you send it to my email, could have, we can take a walk because I don't want to miss any of the things that happened in the class.So I'm dropping my email in the chat. I think you might have it. But if you just email it there, I could take it and show you.Not everything is spelled properly.

**Sharda Flores**Yes, good.

**Will Krasnow**That is, that is, judging you.

**Sharda Flores**Okay. Did you just say?

**Will Krasnow**I said we're judging you.

**Christopher Lothian**more than judge.

**Sharda Flores**All right here. Well, I just sent it to you as a role as it possibly can be. Good.

**Will Krasnow**Right. And that's one of the things we're working on too. It's like we want to make it so it's like you don't have to spend all this time formatting your notes.

**Sharda Flores**Actually, this is good because I need this to make sure. Okay, great. Oh, I was gonna work on it this morning.Yes, yes.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, amazing. And we forgot to come in. We have an affiliate today, the parade. Everyone's very excited about that.

**Sharda Flores**I'm excited. You have a couple schools today?

**Will Krasnow**Oh, the school. Oh, more or less whispered that. We have the parade for the Super Bowl. All the schools are closed actually.Oh, wow. They will never do that here ever.

**Sharda Flores**Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**Great. Okay. sweet. All right. So I've copied and pasted your notes. going to show you this. Are you sharing?I'm sharing now. Can you see? Where's the phone?

**Sharda Flores**No judgment. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**this is the portal. This is evalviswift score.com. I'll send you the link to this after this call. The way it works is this.I copied your loan from notes. I'm just going to paste them in here. So they're just going in this box.Again, coming soon is the upload PDF where you can just drop. You can drop the text box, but we want to be able to drop handwritten notes.And that's actually something we built out. We're just integrating it into the system. If I put in the teacher's name, and Charda, what is the name of your school?

**Sharda Flores**PSF3?

**Will Krasnow**PSF3. Or actually, can you give me the First initial is it miss miss W miss W. Cool. So all I have to do is do that and then I'm going to click generate report and it's going to take maybe 30 or so seconds to take these notes and do something with it.If you're curious how it works, it is it's AI, right? What we've done unessentially is we've taken what's under the hood of chat TBT or odd or whatever AI you might know and actually we're transitioning to make it entirely what's under the hood of Gemini, which is Google's AI.And just because it seems like schools are going in the Google co-founder is much more technical than me. So he actually does the coding.So my I've There's limits to what I can explain here, but essentially, it's like talking to the AI and training it in such a way that it's like our AI is like the dangerous and generator expert kind of thing.And my hope is, is that when we show you the feedback, you'll be like, Oh, wow, like this is a little bit more aligned to what I would say.And then what Chatting PT would. So for instance, like we, when we give feedback, we kind of structure it so that there's like a performance analysis with positive things and just a description of what happened.And then there's a section for like growth steps and what you can do and specific things. So here it is, it generated the report.Now, this, you'll see the score here on the side, and then we're on the Danssen framework, so that is okay.We leave professional responsibilities blank because that seems to not really be super related to an in-person observation. And what you could do.here is review a high-level summary. This could be just like, all right, you know, what exactly happened with this teacher?Now, the summary is cool, but I think is much more interesting as each of these specific components. So if I want to see like, whoa, whoa, one B got a one out of four.If I disagree with that, I can actually just change that score here, and that's going to change this average.If I want to bring it back, I can click specifically into one B. And on the right, I'm going to see my low inference notes that I uploaded with text that's highlighted that is evidence for the summary, which you'll find on the left.Sharter, is there a specific component that you wanted to look at with this teacher?

**Sharda Flores**One A and one E, so we don't use all of the domains for one A one E. So I think that was, one A, one A was two had two and then rated like I guess developing and then he was rated ineffective so I wanted to see the alignment between that.

**Will Krasnow**Okay sweet so yeah let's look at one A. So again if I want to edit it I can just edit it here, edit any of the text and if I want to copy it just click this button and put it into advance.But for now I'll just scroll through here and you can read it and tell me what you think.

**Sharda Flores**Those my comments so the words too small for the students. So what I have to do is not put my, because this is very, this is very bold.I thought she was going, I was also giving my next steps, right? So the picture is very high, the video is very high level, picture is very possible.So I see where this could work, where you're extracting the information from it to support the Danielson. What it picked up was my, was my next step.It says evidence by the observation, yes, the Bay was very high levels for the students. The words are too small.So these are my next steps for her. I mean, it's basically coded according to what the Daniel and would do the lens of the dynasty, right?Yes, yes. If you go down to paragraph two, yeah. So that spot on actually. Right, because there was that's my next part because there was no assessment there at all or any any any kind of gauge of students understanding as she was going to the last night.There were questions, but the questions were very basic. There was not much going on that, you know, engage of kids through conversations or whatnot, but that that was my next step there.Sweet. what was saying to look like. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**One thing I want to mention, which I think you'll find really interesting is. If I I'm gonna go to our designs, can you just see me did you see me change tabs?

**Sharda Flores**No, okay here Let me just pull it up So this one is coming with that update in two weeks So let me let me sidebar the country Please, know what I would AI becoming the way it is right now I'm like almost afraid that you know I now think it's gonna happen, but it's always you know, it's always discussion in my head like I don't want my support to be like, hey, we use AI for these things But like I'm always a fan of looking to see how far this can be detected on that end like chat GPT You put in so you put the book the I did something where I pulled someone's email and I put it in and it detected picked up Where it came from?Like I don't want this to become like, you know, it's like a comment from our superintendent like hey Make sure you're authentic or make sure whatever I doubt you know, but can this be so that'sI just want to say I don't care if he picks it up and I hear your concern I'm just gonna say I work on efficiency so that would be my rationale you guys don't think we still hear our voice as principal through this because you get to edit I just feel like it's like it makes life easier for us we're not making this up like we're just writing it in and it's just helping us like put together our thoughts and our notes and efficiently so it's not like we're briefing it or writing like some details about it we have the entire lesson yeah and that's the other thing too if I uphold the lesson will there be able to gauge that because that was a question I had in my mind as well because I'm gonna ask for plans and I want to be able to extract that will it make a connection from what the teacher's plan looks like to what was actually captured on the on the low entrance notes so starter you're like two steps ahead of me I'll show you I'll show you our design

**Will Krasnow**it's for coming features. Ready? here's one.

**Sharda Flores**Notice how it has a evaluator comment here.

**Will Krasnow**Teacher does X. So what this is, is when you, because we've had this before, like when a principal says, Oh, teacher, teacher needs to do this.It's like, it's not quite low inference. It's not like, uh, this is what happened, but it's my perspective. We're going to identify that as your comments.And then factor that in accordingly. wait, the AI sometimes will be like, Oh, well, the teacher said this. It's like, no, you were just thinking that.So we're going to have that in and we're going to automatically identify that. And if you disagree with him, you can just X that out.

**Sharda Flores**that's the first one.

**Will Krasnow**And then on the next of including the lesson. So here, we're going to ask five questions before generating reports, you're going be some capital for like special ed or ECE.What range of the course

**Christopher Lothian**you were in and then like what curriculum you're teaching towards and do you want to upload it like lesson that was there and then to your point that will then go and factor into the analysis that comes from our AI but really good question but I'm just going to say we have to be cautious with that because in New York City we can't rate the evaluation we can't rate the lesson plan so if the lesson plan for that day can't be tied into the evaluation if you don't support whether not that teacher needs a support with the lesson plan because if the lesson plan looks so good I hear you but he's saying for what I understood was like they're taking that lesson plan and attaching it to the notes that we have and then using that as part of the evaluation or overall rationale on the lesson no I misspoke that's on me it's not so much the lesson that they created

**Will Krasnow**more so, here's the curriculum they're teaching towards, so that when you provide flow rate from H and stuff like that to see, I guess, where yeah, yeah, all right, yeah, that's a good point, but good point, no, no, we're not like using that as like evaluating the lessons that they created, no, okay, no, that makes sense if you're like doing a comparison about what the lower inference notes, and then what the lesson was supposed to, right, exactly, it's to be, okay, the growth path here, this is for 1b, do you want to take a look at this?

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that was basically one of my, one of my, um, my, my thesis,

**Sharda Flores**responses that are in there. was like, when are we stopping to assess the kids? Even if it's the way we, we shift in the questions that we're asking on the spot.So that was, that's pretty cool. And then you said the bottom. Yeah. See, I didn't see the differentiate instruction because I went into a time where the kids were like doing that explicit teaching.So I think that would be like, my next. This would be your next. Yeah, that was my next step.Like when I come in, I want to see how you're differentiating for those students who struggle with specifics. Okay, cool.I'm sorry. I'm not too worried about the next steps and stuff because sometimes it's like you, it's clear. Like, you know what?Yeah. It's just a sitting writing of it and it's evidenced by and calling because Danielson doesn't talk like straightforward.It's like, right. Few, many poses, some questions that I'm like, what is that? What's that? right? I'm low cognitive and I'm like well what the heck is that?So then it's just making sure that our understanding as principles kind of like aligns with what the Daniel's in the same, but the Daniel's in the soul for loop itself that is just like you have to figure it out.But I think that that is key. Next steps it's really nice to what you guys word it because I'm just gonna bring that in to what I kind of saw in the moment.So we're giving me for next step for the action.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet, amazing. And then so the one thing I do want to show you too and you'll tell me if maybe you're like all right I got this part or this is a nice whole add-on or you know I'll just proceed for showing this tool.So you can click into any of these, you can change any of the feet, the components that you disagree with.I can then click this, I would log in on the account on the top right, but I already am logged in and I could click this kind of pencil here and that's going to take me to my overview.So to your point right, like we don't want. you're going back and forth to touch EBT and then like a lot of information is lost.Everything's going to be stored in here and then your evaluations over time with MSW will be shown with the total average to the percent change the number of evaluations that are in.And you're going to see this for all of your teachers so this can make help identify trends for PLC or what have you.And if you click into the NA box here or you know before even doing that I'll just show you each teacher has an average page.So this looks similar but this is the average of all their Daniel Sim. So I can edit these and if I go down I can actually map and track you know here five or so over time.If I wanted to find a specific coaching focus I could go here and so we were talking about 1B for differentiating instruction.If I do 1 I scroll down I do 1B and I is going to suggest a couple different action steps we can pick.And then from there, a couple more specific implementation strategies that you can apply. And then it's going to create a coaching report based on that.So we said differentiating instruction. And then I'll let you pick what these focus areas that is most appropriate.

**Christopher Lothian**Well, I just want to say I have two more minutes before I have to jump on another meeting.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. Yeah.

**Sharda Flores**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Well, I'll say this and then I don't say I'm sorry that I'm going to send you a follow up with the link to the tool.We are I can also do a tutorial. We are start up. So after certain amount of uses, like it will come with a charge.I'm going to actually because it's been just so helpful to like extend you guys through. through a couple more weeks, so you can get more accustomed to the tool.My only ask is that you just give me feedback along the way for you, but I'll send you in a follow-up, and if you have questions along the way, just message me and I'm going to put my number two.So you can just text me if there's an issue or a question or anything. Again, if you're sent in, no.

**Sharda Flores**I have a few questions to ask you, and Chris, you and I will talk right up if you can't stay on.

**Christopher Lothian**Yeah, actually have a meeting with Rose.

**Sharda Flores**Oh my friend, tell him I have a guard.

**Christopher Lothian**I love him. I'm going to call him later.

**Sharda Flores**Tell him I'll call him later. All right. Hello, guys.

**Christopher Lothian**I'll follow up with Shardah and Will. I'll look for your email. Yes, thank you. Thanks for your time.

**Sharda Flores**Let's go back to 1E really quick. I just want to see something. 1E. Yeah, go to click on 1E, right, and then let me go.I want to see what that looks like, because this is really cool. I like this. I'm glad. So the way I don't end.I guess it's not the greatest example from my notes because I go and I highlight what's the next step as we go into that right?Just like it's really hard because and I know Christopher doesn't really care about it But I just don't want to get to a point where our super intense life This is not valid and it imbalances right right cuz we're using Professional intelligence I doubt will but it's always a you know, that's the negative in my head This is why I was asking this to just see where it and like I said I don't know if he'll do it.He does have someone that does advance and looks over I just want to make sure they don't grab it and put an AI and it comes up because when I did it with the detector It showed up.Right.

**Will Krasnow**I did rightlessly.

**Sharda Flores**I did type for me I did like I'm looking for your oldie the thing that nuances outside Sometimes it's just didn't get it's too much to look for and I just said I just say screw it Go into um, so you did one E strengthening current connections to learning objectives click that one really quick and thenYou can use one right here. It seems so, yeah.

**Will Krasnow**OK, so connect.

**Sharda Flores**Clarifying learning objectives, the second one. Gotcha.

**Will Krasnow**So yeah, I'll show you this. So this is the report page. You can generate as many reports as you want.And they're going to show up in this page. You can choose what's relevant. That's going to be dated. It shows up here, who's the teacher for?It starts with a series of good things that the teacher did, right? Like, an example is that come from the low inference net.Now, once you scroll through these, it identifies the area. clearly defining communicating learning objectives to students before the lesson begins.The evidence.

**Sharda Flores**I see what it's doing. see the point. If I gave you the actual, like, and I code differently. My coding is a little bit different than any.I don't put E in S and T and S. I know who said what. You know, that's my um, but yeah, I do like the way this is like I do like this and then it's a series of action steps with an implementation strategy for basically their next steps exactly the goal.So it's there. It's where you put the teachers next steps. So I love how this is basically broken down by any chance isn't broken down by see so connections address the feedback that the video was to it.So yes, so that's something that that's all right. So I see what you're doing it. Is there any way that the feedback is broken down by the domains by the domains.If you go up to the top. You It is teach boost yes that is it okay good to know I do have you gotta go okay So I send you this file as for as 20 at school that alright, so that's my email as far as 20 and we'll go from there Okay, but let me step outside

**Will Krasnow**Thanks. Well, take care.

**Sharda Flores**Bye bye. Bye bye.

Yeah, um, I'm, I'm in Kancha Hakkin.

**Will Krasnow**Got you. Got you.

**Nichole Polk**Um, I did that. I was like in and out. that was cool. They have this new series more. Um, do you call it?Uh, Hulu. So I watched the first couple episodes of this paradise.

**Will Krasnow**Hey, Nicky, how you doing?

**Nichole Polk**I'm good. We met we met with Angela earlier today and everybody's meeting from home. This is the first time.This is the first time. Yeah, we had.

**Matt Kelley**Yeah.

**Nichole Polk**I'll take it though.

**Matt Kelley**Yeah.

**Nichole Polk**Matt, have you ever seen a show called paradise?

**Will Krasnow**I'm not familiar with it.

**Matt Kelley**Yeah, it just came out of Hulu.

**Will Krasnow**They have like the first episode. Yeah, it was good. It's good.

**Nichole Polk**It's about, actually, it's about a president that was murdered. They're trying to figure out who did it, but the world, as we know it no longer exists in a mood that the world was going to not exist at one point.So since they knew that was coming, they built a secret city under some mountains in Colorado. Is it in the future?Is it like a future? Yeah, it's in the future, but at the same time feels like private time. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Nichole Polk**Yeah. It's so far so good. I just started a show.

**Will Krasnow**Have you ever heard of the show, Deep?

**Matt Kelley**Oh, yeah.

**Nichole Polk**It was a little while ago, but I don't remember watching it though. It's one of my next on like HBO.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**I'm late to the game. It's not a new show. Yeah.

**Matt Kelley**I think it's, I think it's hysterical.

**Nichole Polk**You like it?

**Will Krasnow**I do.

**Matt Kelley**I do. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**The guy, the guy knows that he was in a restaurant.

**Matt Kelley**The development, he was buster. He's like her bag. Her bag.

**Will Krasnow**I love that guy. Yeah, he's like the same character.

**Matt Kelley**Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, the guy that played and this is us.

**Nichole Polk**I think he was. He's a husband. Yeah, but he's in this. Yeah.

**Matt Kelley**Cool, cool.

**Will Krasnow**Well, again, thanks, Nikki, hopping on. I'm super excited to show you what we got today, but Matt, maybe you could give us a brief intro contextualize the combo.Yeah.

**Matt Kelley**mean, Nikki, know, kind of the journey I went on. got swept up in the AI revolution and started thinking about through folks like, you know, Charlotte and others, you know, how can we just save people time?And so you were there from from the beginning with like the rollout of, you know, the training we did with cohort seven, the email.interface with the Daniels and stuff. So long story short, we were saying this morning, like maybe four months ago, five months ago, I got connected to Will through a guy that had been helping me out and think through some stuff at Penn, and Will's launching an EdTech company.And as I was figuring out that I was going this direction back to ICS, was like, I'm not going to have the time or the space to really keep working on this.Will was interested in picking it up. so we partnered together. And what Will and his brother and the Switch 4 team have done is just incredible.So when you see all that it can do today, and then you look at like the Daniels and email, I mean, it's like comparing like a tricycle to a Maserati Ferrari, like a different ball game.That is exciting. So we got to Tangela this morning, like I was saying, and you know, she had reallythe feedback and and really and good constructed feedback for us as well so excited to show it to you and Will is really going to lead it you know from here he's got the link and he'll walk you through like a demo and then we'll do some of your evaluations and hopefully save you some time instantly on that and get you a link and all that kind of stuff and yeah so we're collaborating once you always reach out to me if you want to talk you know kind of one to one but what I and I don't think I highlighted this for Tangel I think what really sold me with Will and his work is that the first time I met him and kind of joined in he was they have another kind of like function to their platform but he was meeting with his own high school teacher who he was getting it in her hands to get her feedback and I'm I just really valued versus many of people I've met Will's commitment to keep educators and not just do what you know maybe people go to school and they're like I know how to do this I went toHigh school. I want to be 12. just appreciate his commitment to like making sure that What he's creating is meeting our needs and so I think you're gonna see today just some really great stuff I'll leave it at that and I'll pass it back to you will and to you all I'm gonna hang out like if I can answer any questions or something like that But again, I'll kind of I'll fade to the background a little bit after at this point.

**Will Krasnow**Okay Thank you Matt very much But yeah, I think Matt hit the nail in the head We are taking his inspiration and turning it into a formal tool And we're super dedicated in building AI centered tech for educators compatible with The existing frameworks and ways of thinking that you already do so we're not trying to change anything or shake it up We're just really trying to make it easier for you and then alsomaybe even help you Reach the next level and so this is as you know particularly centered around creating evaluations and coaching plans For your teachers if it's okay I would love to ask you a couple questions before you're showing you the tool Then you set up on the tool for yourself.So you to math point try it out Maybe we can save you some time on this call here and then ask you a couple follow-up questions.Does that work?

**Nichole Polk**Mm-hmm.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, amazing Generally, and I I'm not sure if you were able to fill out this question on How long does it take you to convert low inference notes to an evaluation ready to put into power school for a single teacher I would have to say before Using the tool that met

**Nichole Polk**with us, it would take me a while, it would take me a while, yes, because I would go into a class and just have a word document and type up things that I saw, then I would have to make sense out of what I wrote and then put it up.Then, wait a minute, I put it up, but then let me make sure is it aligned to what I said or what I think, like now I would take a moment to make sure that what I'm seeing is also aligned to the Danielson domain and then I would flush out you know what my next steps were.So, it would take me a while.

**Will Krasnow**And this is before Matt's tool, correct? Yes, this is before Matt's tool. So, if you had, this is still before Matt's tool, if had to put a number on it.Are we talk it? Yeah. General flow doesn't have to be exact.

**Nichole Polk**I would say about 30 minutes. observation. Nice.

**Will Krasnow**And how many observations do you do a week? We do.

**Nichole Polk**I do four to eight. Four to eight.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. So now let's talk post-maps tool. Are you actively using it still?

**Nichole Polk**Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**now how long does it take you now using that tool?

**Nichole Polk**I would say about 15 minutes, 10 to 15 minutes. Yeah. Because it gives so much information, which is great.So I look through to make sure that it is speaking to exactly what I saw and then some things I do take out.So it takes me a Just a few more minutes, but it's still so much easier. Nice.

**Will Krasnow**So, make this clear, what you're doing is actually not adding to Matt's tool. What you're really doing is cutting it down.Yeah. Interesting. Amazing. Okay. Now, what about creating coaching plans for a teacher? How long does that usually take? You're going to sit down and like, all right, want to create, you know, identify coaching focus for my, for my teacher and maybe a next step or two.

**Nichole Polk**I would have to say maybe in terms of like a coaching plan, that's maybe about an hour to two.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. And how many do you usually do a week?

**Nichole Polk**Coaching plans. I would have to say that goes along like if a teacher is like really struggling. Yeah, he's like normally with the.feedback if they are if they're not struggling. I'm not necessarily doing a coaching plan, but if a teacher is struggling, then I would be doing one.And I would have to say for this year, I have one teacher that has a coaching plan.

**Will Krasnow**Interesting. So for the teachers that you think are doing well, you don't have coaching plans for that?

**Nichole Polk**Well, no, even if what I'm saying is that a teacher that consistently is not doing well, like you're having a hard time with taking my feedback implementing, you want a coaching plan.

**Will Krasnow**I understand. So to make sure I get this straight, your typical process for like helping teachers grow is centered around the evaluation.Now, if somebody wasn't progressing with regards to the feedback you're giving on each evaluation, then you're like, okay, let's step back and do an in-depth coaching plan.Yes. Understood.

**Nichole Polk**Understood.

**Will Krasnow**Very cool. And you said one just for this year. there was still more guys. Now, on a scale of one to five, how confident are you about your coaching abilities?And I'm using coaching as like the broad sense of a term. So with evaluations and coaching focuses together. I'm going to give myself a three.

**Nichole Polk**Nice.

**Will Krasnow**Nice. On a scale of one to five, how confident are you that your coaching improves teacher growth?

**Nichole Polk**I don't see a four. Nice.

**Will Krasnow**on a scale of one to five, how confident are you that your coaching improves student growth? I would say a four.

**Nichole Polk**Nice. Nice.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. Super helpful. Now, this is, I'm adding in a question because I'm curious. Mention a three out of five for confidence.it's in your personal coaching. What makes you feel why isn't that I guess the first way to phrase is why isn't that a one or a two?

**Nichole Polk**In terms of which one was that about my coaching? Just like how confident are you in your general coaching?

**Will Krasnow**Oh why isn't it a one or two?

**Nichole Polk**think because I have strong relationships with my teachers I have strong relationships with my teachers. I am not only do I have strong relationships with them I'm also a part of their PLC so I'm part of the learning with them but was like you know once I'm giving them if I'm giving them feedback because we have the relationship and I'm boots on the ground it is um feedback is welcomed if that makes sense.Understood.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. And why is it not a four or five?

**Nichole Polk**Um because I'm just I'm humble like that.

**Will Krasnow**Always room for growth. Yes, exactly.

**Nichole Polk**I'm always I'm learning and growing to bear.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, amazing. Okay, so I'm gonna show you what the tool is like first before getting set up on account Just because I think that's a little bit easier and then I'm gonna have you present screen and I'm gonna send you a link And you can check it out that way so the first thing I'm gonna show you is this page here, so we are still improving the user interface a little bit and Just completely ironing out all bugs But this should capture the core functionality of the tool and it like man has said, know, it's already being used by Kelly Espinoza who was the original person we launched with and and now Tangela and you are our third third call here and Now we're at this stage of bringing it to 15 different schools.So again, you're third out of 15 and And so this is after I uploaded low inference notes and I did it already justinterest of time. And what I was able to do is select Philadelphia schools as opposed to like the entire Denison framework.And then, you know, the score is going to generate a score for each of the criteria. We leave professional responsibilities blank because that's not really related to classroom observations, but you can still go in and add to it if you want.And below here, you could see a general overview of how the teacher did. And this is good to contextualize what's, you know, tearing low inference notes into some kind of conclusion.But what I'm going to guess is a little bit more interesting is you can click into each specific criteria and get feedback to then give to your teacher.So what that looks like is let's do T2C. If I click into T2C, I can see my low inference notes on the right here.these were the ones that I uploaded. And then, On the left, it's going to pull the highlighted sections from the low inference notes that are related to component two seat and create a summary.And that summary is two components. First is paragraph one, which is just a performance analysis. Like what happened here, generally?What was good, what glow and a grow? And then from there, provide feedback related to how can we help this teacher grow?So this is the component that is at core, similar, very similar to Matt's tool. We've adapted a bit how the AI thinks about creating responses.And then in addition to sectioning here, right? So if you wanted to go to 2B or 2E, you could click into it.Let me go back here. Now, another thing, too, is all of this can just be copied and pasted and put right into power school.And you could also edit each of these sections, right? So to your point, one of the things we want to make easier is like, well, let's say there's too much info.I could go in here, you know, cut out these sentences. And then it's automatic. Yeah, a lot of times I'll go in, like, you know, you have teacher.

**Nichole Polk**I may pick up the teacher's name or whatever. Like so it can feel more like coming from me. Understood.Understood. Right.

**Will Krasnow**minor, minor, but yeah. And then that's also the kind of feedback we'd love to hear and see, we could just auto do that as well.Like one of the things we heard and I'm going to guess you're going to feel the same way is, oh, is like, rather than saying the teacher, if it's not the teacher's name, which works, sometimes even just like you or address them in your direction.Okay. That's something we can certainly do. And then there is, we'll get into this in a bit, like a way to create a coaching plan, which I would recommend is done either if you're doing.or like, you know, specific teacher and creating this big coaching plan for them, or even just to enhance the feedback you give to your existing teachers.But before I even get into that, I'd love to stop here, ask you your general thoughts and then get you set up yourself.

**Nichole Polk**Oh, I think it looks great.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, let me see. I'm going to send into your chat this link. If you copy and paste that into your browser, then present your screen so I could follow along with you in your browser, I'd be very happy to see you.

**Nichole Polk**And then you said, wait minute.

**Will Krasnow**All right present now yes exactly yeah oh here it is I was like looking for the screen okay perfect okay so now that you're here would you mind pulling up some low inference notes that you have maybe for an evaluation you haven't created yet we can see how it how it does okay we can go over here they can pop it yeah just paste it right there into the enter text boxIs this, is this is what you, what you have after an observation, yes, interesting. So the way you structure your notes is rather than just, you, you section it off by glows and grows and or through the action step while you're in the classroom.Yes, I try to.

**Nichole Polk**Very cool.

**Will Krasnow**Does that help you kind of save time when it comes to.

**Nichole Polk**Yes.

**Will Krasnow**Yes.

**Nichole Polk**But then I'll still use Mets platform to like double check myself if that makes sense. Hmm.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. Understood. So I'm curious, the low inference notes we take in are formatted slightly differently, but I. You want to put in the teacher's name and the school, up top and the two boxes above.Oh, right here, teacher's name? Okay, I can make up a name.

**Nichole Polk**Yeah, we need a real teacher's name.

**Will Krasnow**I would recommend doing the real teacher's name. You could put just their initials if that makes you more comfortable.Okay.

**Matt Kelley**And Nikki just double check. So you're not taking kind of like teacher action, student action notes in real. It's more just you're kind of like processing the lesson and right to the.

**Nichole Polk**Okay.

**Matt Kelley**Yes.

**Nichole Polk**Yeah. Sounds good.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing.

**Nichole Polk**Did I generate or no?

**Will Krasnow**Now you can click generate report. Sweet. So now that's going to take about a minute and it's going to do.would I just did for that sample evaluation to this? Once it shows up, what I'm going to be interested in, or actually, you know what, I could ask you this now, is it helpful?And brutal honesty is great for us. Having the evaluations show up in the kind of format that you saw me present before, or is the chat bot that you were working with with Matt's person doing just fine?

**Nichole Polk**I think from what, are you saying like from the, from it coming up like in that paragraph form, on one side and then the other side, having the different like domains?Yeah, exactly. I think, I mean, comparing it to Matt's, Matt's format will have it all laid out. So it's like a two A, here's something to be, here's something, you know, I think that is that is very convenient, but I also feel like the way that you have that I can always just click on it.So it's not. It's not like it doesn't exist. Right.

**Will Krasnow**Gotcha. And is it helpful to see it as it shows there with a score on the left and you can see the different components.Oh, I from Matt at the bottom, or are you speaking about yours. I'm speaking of mine.

**Nichole Polk**Oh, no, this is fine. I think this is fine.

**Will Krasnow**So it looks like in this, might be one of the bugs I was talking about that we're hiring now.Do you mind refreshing your screen? So it looks like you just got planning and preparation. Can you click the back button?I'm going to have us regenerate this evaluation. And again, yeah Not to look into if you go to I can have if you can you go back to just in your browser just eval by flip score calm You could go back to that main page Oh That's okay, you know what we can do is we can just look at one a just the components for for one I'm sorry about that.You know, it's fine.

**Nichole Polk**Okay, so But you know now looking at it Like I see the one a 1b, you know all the way down to 1f then you say if I click on this Okay, no, I just clicked on that.What does that mean so what you

**Will Krasnow**is you just turned that from a score of three to a score of one because you'll see there are four components there.So if you want to go back to three, click there.

**Nichole Polk**if you want to know.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Nichole Polk**So no, I do think I do think Matt's format is a little better for me. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Tell me what?

**Nichole Polk**It's just I it feels like is streamlines the process for me. So I can go straight into the summary and I can just see all of the components that I am scoring all of the domains, what the score is and then what the feedback is.Got you.

**Will Krasnow**So if you go up and then click on let's say one a and not the little box there but go on this right here.Yeah.

**Nichole Polk**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**So that's going to pop up this right and you're going to see your lower kids notes on the right and then the summary on the left.

**Nichole Polk**Okay. Tell me. Sorry. I was to say no. This is okay.

**Will Krasnow**good. Yeah, this is good.

**Nichole Polk**Um, but then what was the score? The score is where you just clicked beforehand.

**Will Krasnow**There was like a three, but would it be helpful to see it on this page as well? Yes.

**Nichole Polk**Okay. Yeah, for sure.

**Will Krasnow**So, and then it's like say, um, so it's platform also gives is the score.

**Nichole Polk**It gives the rating. It will say proficient and what their score is, or is it just proficient? They'll say proficient, failing, or distinguished.Got you. Yeah, that's something we can certainly answer.

**Will Krasnow**Um, because you'll see that before. If you close out, you could see that for one, and that's what you just adjusted.But then when you click into it, you can't see it.

**Nichole Polk**That's helpful feedback.

**Will Krasnow**would you mind going to look at the summary provided here? Okay. I'm curious what you think. This is on point, I like that.Amazing. Amazing.

**Nichole Polk**I'm down in paragraph two. I like how the next steps are clear and concise. I can understand it. Yeah, this is good.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**So now you mentioned before that part of your process was sometimes cutting it down, right? Is there anything here that you would want to cut out or think it's just a little bit much?Nope easy great Cool so if you close out of this This one here I'm gonna have you click login at the top right And at the bottom you'll see sign up don't have an account sign up And if you click sign up and you sign up here We can I'm gonna you'll be able to save this evaluation and that's gonna let you create a coaching plan and interested The password you give me that or I hit the new you create your own password.Oh, okay It Did it create a count?

**Nichole Polk**Perfect, yeah.

**Will Krasnow**And then click the button, I think that worked, if you click the pencil in the middle. I'm going to have you click my account in the top and then X out of that.And let's do click new evaluation in the top right. Do you have another evaluation, we can put it into the system.Amazing, and click generate report. This will take, again, a minute or two, and then what we're going to do here is generate that coaching plan.And I'm curious how that will fare. Okay, well that's a load. Of course, I'm going to give you access to the tool you could totally play around, mess around with it afterwards, but assuming that the feedback or let me just, this is how I think you're receiving the tool and you let me know if I'm on base.The feedback it provided was spot on and that was actually more precise than the preliminary tool and that could save you that extra 15 minutes per evaluation where you're cutting stuff out.Yes. The UI, A, just take some time to adjust to it because you're used to a mouse tool. B, could use minor tweaks that end up being pretty important such as certainly the thing where we could just say like you for the teacher's name, but other more important things like when you click into it, you could see the score up top and then the, like whether they're proficient.or no? Is that, that's on base? Okay, sweet. And we'll see how we do with the coaching. Okay. Okay, amazing.You can click, if you want to check out, do you want to check out any of these criteria? Now, the summary is all of it together.

**Nichole Polk**The summary is all of it together.

**Will Krasnow**It's just a brief overview.

**Nichole Polk**Okay, let's look at this over there. I made the summary. Sure. This is great. This is great. I like it.Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Cool. Do you want to check out any of components or do you want to look at the coaching? Oh, I want to look at the coaching.

**Nichole Polk**Okay. Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**click at the pencil in the top, top, middle. Okay. So here's our G click. So wait, just something before I'll mention this.Another thing that we did with this tool. So unlike Matt's tool before, one of the things that we built out was we're going to store all of these evaluations over time.I'm going to show you how many evaluations are in there. You can access your old ones. You're also going to be able to see the average score across the different evaluations and how that's changing over time.Oh, that's not. And I'm seeing because I can visualize all my teachers here. So maybe that's helpful for. C planning or even just, you know, for a specific teacher, like why was the percent change negative?What can I do to step in here? if you are doing a specific teaching plan for a teacher, that's going to show up in the top right of that card for the teacher, but you haven't created that yet because of course you just made the teacher.So let's do that now. If you click that NA in that little dotted line box there and then click create new report in the middle of the page.going to see the different domains, right? So you could pick now for RG which domain you want to focus on and we're going to ask a couple follow-up questions so we so you can scroll down just a little and you're going to see the different components of that domain.and you can choose which one from there. Amazing, and you can scroll down further. And what the AI is going to do here is do a subsection of 3B.You can pick which one you want to focus on. Amazing, and then scroll down. There's going to be a specific focus area and then it's going to generate the group.Oh, this is great.

**Nichole Polk**like this.

**Will Krasnow**Cool, so you can pick up these. Perfect. All right. So there's your coach report. It's a little bit spaced out.That's one of the things we're fixing. But if you scroll through, it's going to start with a bunch of different strengths that the teacher needs and do a bunch of different courses of action with hopefully bite size next

**Nichole Polk**Oh, nice. Oh, this is dope. Amazing, amazing. Nice. I like it a lot. Cool.

**Will Krasnow**and it's so comprehensive like look how many like I'm still going yeah that's like really cool amazing okay so and here's the question now so let's say you were focusing on a specific teacher that takes you one to two hours have this tool you generated this first how long do you think it would take you now man what five minutes oh let's go oh amazing yes cool cool I have a question now do you see let's say you have a proficient teacher and be totally honest with me at the answer could be no I'm just curious you have a proficient teacher or they're very great like would you use this function of the website this way coaching plan me absolutely amazing I would use it I would use it all of my teachers because now I would have a tool to that with support

**Nichole Polk**me in giving, you know, or me giving feedback to them that's going to push them in their, you know, instructional practices, which will ultimately, you know, increase student outcomes.yeah, I definitely would. Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. Cool. Okay, great. So I'm going to ask you a couple follow up questions now if that's cool. Okay.Okay, cool. You don't have to present screen anymore.

**Nichole Polk**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**So we said from two hours to like about five minutes. Or just to make sure, I know we kind of touched on this, using the tool for evaluations.How long do you think it would take you now that you have this tool for evaluation?

**Nichole Polk**Probably about five minutes. Just putting information in. Yeah, cool.

**Will Krasnow**For what percent? Well, I guess the first question here would be, do you anticipate using this tool? all after this call?Yes.

**Nichole Polk**I mean them.

**Will Krasnow**For what percent of evaluations anticipate using the tool?

**Nichole Polk**All of them? Nice.

**Will Krasnow**For what percent of coaching plan? All of them?

**Nichole Polk**Everyone's getting one now. I skill of one to five.

**Will Krasnow**Now that you have this tool, how confident do you feel about coaching? Five. Nice. On a scale of one to five, how disappointed would you be if this tool was taken away right now?Which I won't be.

**Nichole Polk**Man, one to five. I would be very disappointed. So a five. Nice.

**Will Krasnow**On a scale of one to ten, how likely would you be to recommend this tool to others? Oh, five.

**Nichole Polk**Sorry. was at this one's out of one to ten. Oh, this is a ten. Sorry. Okay, sweet, sweetie.

**Will Krasnow**That's what I thought you meant, but I have to hear it. In this call, it's clear that you saw significant value in the tool.Is that correct? Yes, it's amazing how long I mean this one is kind of evident about 30 minutes to talk right for you to see that value right it was within this call I saw the value like when you showed as soon as you started showing what you when you were walking me through the platform when you were sharing okay amazing no it didn't take 30 minutes okay like fine amazing uh on a scale one to five now that you have this tool how confident are you that your coaching will improve teacher growth five when it was that one to five this one was one to five yes five get cool uh what about student growth five nice okay amazing so those are the the core questions I have here are the next steps in my mind you have sorry I was gonna say could you or could I

**Nichole Polk**X. in that coaching plan, and in the, like I'm thinking about a student component around like data. So, suppose the coach, like the coaching plan had those questions for how to get kids talking.

**Will Krasnow**Sure.

**Nichole Polk**And more engaged in, you know, what questions to ask. Could it provide like a sample, if it was a more structured, like, if they had more detail, would it be able to give me sample questions that they could then ask, like if you do all of this, and you extra kids this as an exit ticket.Right, right, right. That means that they, you know, um,

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, so you're saying just to get this straight, right, like you're like, it does suggestion and like evidence or whatever, right?But you're giving me examples, right? So it's like if you're saying one of the things was think pair share, right?Give me three, like, and by me, it's you to give to the teacher, and ultimately say to the students, right?

**Nichole Polk**You're a three example.

**Will Krasnow**So they can literally just be like, all right. That's what you need to say.

**Nichole Polk**If we can do that for sure.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, amazing. And this is why we're doing this, too, because again, like I can't do that tomorrow, but yeah, absolutely.You know, yeah, cool. So, by the way, you have the link to the tool, I can also send you an email follow up you don't Ask you to pay.You don't have to pay. just send me a message when that happens and I'll put your name on a list so we'll just bypass that.that goes the same for any assistant principals or anybody at your school who might be interested in using it.Do you think you would be the person using it or is there anyone else who might want be using it?Okay sweet so there's no one else who needs access.

**Nichole Polk**Okay cool.

**Will Krasnow**Do you have assistant principals helping you do coaching or you do or sorry for for or do you do it all?I do but she doesn't like AI.

**Nichole Polk**Okay. Yeah he's okay.

**Will Krasnow**So I was gonna ask you any other features you want to see come in the next month.

**Nichole Polk**You always do if we were able to put in like a standard Yeah, that it would be able to generate some type of assessment or some questions that kids can answer at the end of a teacher teaching that particular standard.

**Will Krasnow**So this would be for the teacher to generate that, right?

**Nichole Polk**Or for me to generate it to then give to the teacher and then give to the teacher. So like I'm thinking about small group instruction, where's like, oh, wow, you know, you have exposed the student to the tier one instruction in the way that the curriculum is telling you, but these students are still having a hard time with them.Okay, so now here's a different way, here's some feedback on how you or your instructional practices. And now you're working with the students in this small group, but now you need an assessment to go along with what it is that you're doing with them in this small group.

**Will Krasnow**Cool. Yeah.

**Nichole Polk**So what's really interesting, like one or two questions, nothing really deep.

**Will Krasnow**Would that be, is this a separate thing than the coaching plan, like, or is this tied in? Is this like, well, we're recommending this specific, you know, teaching practice, and then you could include the standard, or is this just a separate thing that you're talking about?I think it can be both.

**Nichole Polk**I think it can be a separate thing, and then I also think it can be aligned with the coaching plan, because I feel like when it's aligned to the coaching plan, now I'm able to effectively monitor my impact.Got you. From the coaching.

**Will Krasnow**So what's my impact on the teacher and my impact on the student? Right, because you're saying, A, you could see if that's being used in the classroom.B, you could say, how students do with those ones. Yes. So what's really, really interesting is we actually started, we talked about it before.

**Nichole Polk**Very similar.

**Will Krasnow**Yes. Can do it for us? We started with an original tool, and this is actually, we're still building, and it's in its pilot phase, all about assignments and all for teachers.And it's actually why the synergy between, you know, why would work with Matt to build out his tool. It's what it is, it's an assignment management system.what that is, it's like, you could pick your standard. can generate questions based on the standards. actually is like a computer-based assignment environment.students speak them online and all of that stuff. We're currently developing that tool. And one day I would love to show it to you.And then one of the things we've talked about is how do they connect? you give a great idea of like, here's a great way.Yeah. Because ideally it's this one. environment where it's like okay I popped in my evaluations okay now here it generates these assignments for the teacher and then even for the students to complete it all and you know permissions so that the teacher can see how the students do and you can see how the teacher does and the students and title yes cool okay and that brings me to my kind of last point here is so I mentioned we're going to give you free access we are still a company right and and we need you know revenue and all that good stuff what we're going to do at the end of the month is we've been working with Matt and we're probably going to start discussions with the new valor foundation to fund the use of the tool for principles like yourself for like a year right so then you know what you normally would pay if this was like whatever they would sponsor that and once a month mostlikely, would be, you know, we would take the 15 schools we're bringing into is that like, Kelly, you would be, Tangela, it would be you if you're interested and others would come together, we'd ask you similar similar things, what we're doing one-on-one right now, go and feedback, and we're probably going to even get Penn Graduate School of Education in and maybe get to do some formal research.Tides, like, is this, can we have data to back that this do not come and all that.

**Nichole Polk**Is that something? Yes, I would be interested in that. And that is why that other component would be so important because the New Bar Foundation, they're all about data.

**Will Krasnow**this working?

**Nichole Polk**Like, yes, they would be okay. You know, they are a couple who will put the money out there, but it's like, they want to be able to see that is being, that is havingthrough the impact that's being impacted by this. Yeah, amazing.

**Will Krasnow**I my computers at 2% so I'm going make this quick. I know my charges not working right now. think it broke on it, but the only other thing is messaging me.If you questions when you use the tool again, we're releasing in about a week maximum to, you know, just a little bit smoother UI and there are couple like little bugs or whatever that we're just formally testing and ironing all that stuff out.So if there's something you could just message me, we'll get on top of it. And when is the next time you're going to, you anticipate using the tool so I could just flag that on my calendar.

**Nichole Polk**Most likely next week. Okay, sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. So I'll reach at the end of the week or the beginning or. Probably the beginning.

**Nichole Polk**I mean, I might even able to use it tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's just a half day.

**Will Krasnow**It's kind of important.

**Nichole Polk**It says Thursday and Friday, so it's a question mark.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, great. So I'll be on standby then. Just shoot me a message by because this is cool stuff and I'll bring back your thoughts the team and hopefully we can get working on on some of those new features.

**Nichole Polk**All right, sounds good. Sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing.

**Nichole Polk**thank you again.

**Will Krasnow**Have a great rest of your day. You too, honey.

**Nichole Polk**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Bye.

**Nichole Polk**Bye.

Hey Matt. Good morning.

**Will Krasnow**Good morning. morning. you doing?

**Matt Kelley**I'm good. How were you? Good, good, first was like, wow, your office is painted a beautiful color. And I realized you're probably at home.can today, you're off. I am not.

**Tangela Mcclam**So my kids are all off having fun. And I'm here at work.

**Matt Kelley**It's, you know, that's the way I thought it would be. But good to see you. Good to see you soon.

**Tangela Mcclam**Tell me, why are you guys off today?

**Will Krasnow**Is it like a superintendent's day or something? It's the Lunar New Year.

**Tangela Mcclam**Oh, nice.

**Will Krasnow**But Matt, you guys didn't get that. No, this is the first year the district is taking us off.

**Matt Kelley**Is that right, Tamsa? That's what I've heard. Yep.

**Tangela Mcclam**As they work to have a more inclusive calendar that I recognize is various groups that are part of the school district, Philadelphia.So some groups gave back a few days and other groups gained some that we can, you know, at least try to celebrate.At least one. for per year, recognize and celebrate for the various groups that compose the school district, the Philadelphia.Nice. That's awesome.

**Will Krasnow**Yes. And you're back tomorrow. We're back tomorrow, but for half days for report card card.

**Tangela Mcclam**wow. Yeah, so it's been a nice week and a very nice week.

**Will Krasnow**Nice, nice. How has the January been treating you so far?

**Tangela Mcclam**Um, you know, it's that time of the year where, you know, you have to revisit systems and people act like they forgot that, you know, you ever said these things?I was spending my time this morning, typing emails, reminding people, celebrating people that met the expectations for practice, monitoring and goal setting and then reminding people that did not do it, setting them to go out tomorrow morning at 8 30.So the queen of the late sin, this is what I have the time to do it. I have to get it done.But, you know, and now we're equals and going to the Super Bowl. So good. Yes. Yes.

**Will Krasnow**I actually, I made it down to Broad Street. Look at that. That's crazy. I thought I saw you on that video, those people climbing a light pole tango, I wasn't sure.

**Tangela Mcclam**See my friends all know me and as soon as like we got to like maybe two minutes and left in the fourth quarter, people are like, are you on Burrow Street?I'm like, I'm loading the car as we speak, like, bro.

**Will Krasnow**Last time I just hopped up and went by myself.

**Tangela Mcclam**This time we took two car loads, my husband, my kids, grandkids, we had a ball until they were asking me was I climbing poles and I've sent them a few videos of what I was doing.That's it. Just give me a few moments and perhaps I will be on the phone. That's crazy.

**Will Krasnow**That was awesome. Matt, would you mind just giving us a brief intro, contextualize the convo and then jump in and get started?don't want to see too much.

**Matt Kelley**Tangel, as you know, short story, know, I got deep into artificial intelligence and how it can help educators, you know, you were one of the early users of the email interface and then the play lab, you know.platform and all that kind of stuff. long story short, there's a person at Penn named John Gamba, who is very active in the edtech space and supporting work at Penn in educational technology.And he connected me to Will, was it like four, six months ago, something like that? early fall?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, ever six, yeah.

**Matt Kelley**Yeah, as Will was developing a company, and then I started sharing with him, you know, the work that and the kind of function and purpose of the Danielson evaluation.And he said, Hey, we'd be interested in kind of building that into our product. And would you partner with us to do that?And I was excited to do it. Because, as you know, I'm now in, you know, I'm here at school and I don't have the time to really drive this myself.So kind of handing it off to Will, not only to keep it going, but he and and Robust. And I'm just really,Excited about what, um, you know, the Swiss score and swift eval team have been able to put together and it's so excited to share it with folks like you.You know, who know the early version and I think like when you see what's going on here. It's like they put it on steroids and did all this amazing stuff, you know, that I had pimped about but never had the skills or, you know, the time necessarily or the ability to put together.And so, yeah, just excited to get your feedback on it and hopefully get you using it and then kind of go from there.

**Tangela Mcclam**Awesome. I'll probably be dropping off around 9.15, but I'm always available.

**Matt Kelley**I think, yeah, my new email address is on this invite. I can put it in the chat too. So if you ever want to connect offline, just let me know.happy to find that.

**Tangela Mcclam**Awesome. Thank you so much, Matt. Yeah, my initial intro into AI like other educators are like, that is for a long time.Well, wow, of course.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, well, Matt, thanks for the intro, and if you need to hop off earlier, I'd be fine, too.

**Matt Kelley**Yeah, good.

**Will Krasnow**I appreciate it.

**Matt Kelley**I'm interested to check out Kansas' initials reaction and stuff like that, too, but then I'll probably, as you get into the conversation, I'll probably hop off.

**Will Krasnow**Sweet. Amazing. yeah, you nailed the potential. The goal for us is helping educators become pros in AI, and specifically, our role in that is building the tooling that makes it intuitive to use AI, and compatible with the existing frameworks and practices you guys are using.So, you know, ChatchMt is cool, Gemini is cool, but how can we build the systems that store information that work with users to actually do the things that are exactly what tie to your job?And, to Matt's point to your point, teacher evaluations, creating observations is a core function of an educator, especially a school leader.And what I would love to do today is just to ask you a couple preliminary questions, give you access to the tool, watch a use the tool, and ask a couple follow-up questions.It's helpful for us. We launched with Kelly Espinosa a couple weeks back, she's been using the tool and we're getting her assistant principles and coaches on the tool.And now we're ready to take it to 15 more schools. And you're actually the first call that we're having after our convos with health.So does that sound all good? Yes, it was wonderful.

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay, amazing.

**Will Krasnow**So I saw on the calendar invite, you said, you spend one hour per day to entry on creating evaluations.Just to be clear, does that mean turning low inference notes to an evaluation, like according to the that's exactly what it means.

**Tangela Mcclam**I spend the bulk of my time getting the data that I've captured in the classroom into a usable format.Or typically, I try to filter it through and kind of see if I'm where I am and it gets bucketed by the various components and then getting it into my school that we have to use.Power school. Power school.

**Will Krasnow**Yes.

**Tangela Mcclam**We're very familiar with Power School.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Understood. Now, how many of those do you have to do per week? I know probably it was mandated to do four, is that the same for your district as well or for your school?

**Tangela Mcclam**My understanding initially was that we had to do 16 per school per week and there were three administrators. So we kind of put that at about somebody would do five or six, know, however we're down an administrator and I'm still trying to figure out if we're still trying to figure out if that means our number is lower, I thought it was my AP thought it remained the same.So I'm going to be on the safe side to say we still have to do 16 per week between the two of us.So eight per week. Wow.

**Will Krasnow**And this is your assistant principal, is that who it is? Or is it an...

**Tangela Mcclam**Yes, assistant principal is the other administrator. five-to-weight assistant principal, who's now still very much of a up-to-weight, but now supporting K to four as well.Understood.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. Because you guys are at K to eight school, right? Yeah, we are. Nice.

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**now that is, I'm going to guess, separate from creating an evaluation that, I'm sorry, excuse me, creating a coaching plan or a coaching focus for a teacher.That is... And I'm assuming you do that as well, right? Yeah. How often are you doing that per week?

**Tangela Mcclam**So I don't typically put people in coaching cycles, so it takes a whole lot of time, maybe every four to six weeks, as we are developing the plans to say, you know, this is what we're going to do for this person.

**Will Krasnow**And generally, to come up with a specific coaching plan, plan for a teacher for that coaching cycle. If you had a ballpark, how long does that take you?

**Tangela Mcclam**That takes, honestly, less time just because I do use AI or some chat GPT or something to kind of bucket it and look at next step.So that takes less time, but most of the time is really like filtering through to see if it feels like the right step for teachers.Okay, understood.

**Will Krasnow**I have three more questions and then I'm excited to show you the book. On a scale of one to five, how confident are you in your coaching abilities right now?

**Tangela Mcclam**I would say abilities, I think I'm like three and a half four, trying to make sure that I'm doing all the coaching is probably at like a one with all the different things.

**Will Krasnow**Understand, understand. Scale of one to five, how confident are you that your evaluations in coaching improves teacher growth?

**Tangela Mcclam**I'm going to say that's probably at a out of three just because of the amount of time to be able to follow up and go back and see what we've asked them to do.And I should also say that we do have coaches in the building. They don't always necessarily develop plans. I tend to like to develop the plans to say here's where you fit in in the place.I understand. I understand.

**Will Krasnow**How many coaches do you have in the room?

**Tangela Mcclam**Two. So we have two dedicated coaches, one for reading one for math, but we also have our school-based teacher leaders who we ask to coach around domain too.So my aspects, the ones for content, they'll do the content and my two SPT also kind of split it for K to four, five, three, for domain two.I understand.

**Will Krasnow**Now, final question here. Honesty, how confident are you that you're coaching? Ultimately, not only for teacher growth, then student growth, makes it ultimately to the student.

**Tangela Mcclam**That's probably around the, I must say, take it down a half a notch, two and a half three. Understand.

**Will Krasnow**Understand. And I'm making up an additional question because I'm curious. said you used chat TBT for coaching plans, not necessarily evaluations.I use it for the evaluation.

**Tangela Mcclam**But the bigger issue is, the bigger issue is getting all of these notes cleaned up. I normally type them and get them in.So once all of that work is done, I then can just go back and say, help me develop a coaching plan, because all the data entry is done.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, understood. interesting. Okay. Great. I am going to pull up our tool. The functionality is all there. has been being used.We're slightly tweaking just the kind of user interface. So what we built is, as you'll see here, a tool that allows you just to add your loan, for instance, whether they're typed.or PDF in any format. You don't have to worry about formatting. You just pop it in here. So I'm going to pull, and I'm going to show it to you first, and then actually just give you access to tool.You can use it yourself. But I want to just show you the steps. So I don't have to walk you through it for the first time when I'm not on your computer.So you enter the text here, right? You put the teacher name. Let's do Matt Kelly. And let's say he's at ICS.I upload my loan print notes, or I could upload it by a PDF, and I just click Generate Report.Now this is going to take up to a minute on making it a little bit faster, and you could see the little steps that it's doing along the way.And what this is going to generate is a score and feedback for each Danielson framework. And we actually have adapted it tofor the Philadelphia schools as well so you don't have to worry about those other criteria that you probably don't care about and that's also I'm sorry is it also adapted for Philadelphia shifted the scale yes well it it will be currently not yet but we are that is something we're investing that correct me if I'm wrong that isn't in place yet no I think it it so I so I think the true then you send goes like I can't even remember what true day you send does it's like one to four something like that but the school district does like zero to three oh oh just in terms of the the numbers right um I will show you so we we have it on a one to four okay we've adapted it from Philadelphia schools like only the new criteria and then I think there's a couple other changes just coming in uh write that yeah I think so Taylor I think like it's only gonna give you like one C one E or whatever that it's not gonna give you 10 and then

**Matt Kelley**There's that new teacher evaluation framework that's been piloted and they were going to roll it out But then they didn't roll it out and so that's what Will say like hey, we're preparing to make that change Probably for next school year if that's the move that the district makes okay?

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah, exactly.

**Will Krasnow**Thanks, So it's gonna pop up all that stuff Everything is editable and Formatted based on the specific criteria so I could show you here.So here's the Dan. Yes, and let's just look at Philadelphia schools I'm going to see the score on each of the relevant criteria.You'll notice how professional responsibilities is left blank Because that's as I understand it often just not seen from an observation and you're going to have a general summary of how this teacher did right and and If I want to dive a little bit deeper summaries probably helpful just for a quick glance to actually get into the meat ofthat you want to do, let's say we were looking at 3C, I could click right here on 3C, and that's going to pop up the low inference notes that I put in.It highlights the evidence it's pulling for that specific criteria, and then it's going to give me an analysis here.And it's going to do kind of along the lines of what happened, A, and then how can we work with a teacher to improve practice?Kind of like a glow and a grow idea. And at any point you could report a mistake, you could edit the summary itself, quickly copy and paste that right into power school, or even take notes on the side.One of the things we'll also do is flag for you automatically the criteria that we think, you know what, maybe you should take a look at that because the AIIt feels it wasn't super informed. And we want to make sure it's not filling in the blanks with kind of meetup.Yes. You could go up here in the top left and just toggle through the different criteria. It will flag different, sorry, the different components will flag different components of the low inference nodes and then have a new summary here.All of that is quickly edible in powder school. And if you disagree with the score, at any point, again, everything is edible, but I can also just change the score here and I could click around.And that's going to immediately affect the average and what is ultimately stored within Swiss school. After this, I can even create a specific coaching plan and focus for the teacher by drilling down into a bite-sized action step.But before I go into that, I'm going to start. I'll ask you if you have any questions and then have you do this part on your own screen with your own low inference notes.But at first glance, now tell me, how does that look? Do you think this could be useful in your process for creating evaluations?And in terms of formatting, does this kind of help in that process by putting it already in the criteria, having it sectioned off.And do you see that it's like easier than like you said, like all the formatting you'd have to use to use chat GPT directly?It does.

**Tangela Mcclam**Excuse me, because it will allow me to have the notes in. It doesn't solve my problem with those notes into the thing, which is one of my biggest hang ups.I'm still working on that. But it doesn't allow me to just, you know, review everything that was listed by category and.and just be able to copy it and paste it into Power School. Because for some teachers, based on their improvement plan, I'm not looking at all of those categories.So I can just put into Power School. Right, understood.

**Will Krasnow**OK, I'm sending you a link here in the chat, eval-by-swift-score.com, if you copy and paste that into your browser, you should be able to see the terminal there.Let me know if you can do that.

**Tangela Mcclam**There are times my tracking page takes a little crazy, but it's not. No worries. OK, I'm there. OK, sweet.

**Will Krasnow**Would you mind going back to the Google Meet and presenting your screen for that tab so I could watch you do it and talk it through it?

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay, is that now was, okay, there it is, I'm sorry to ask you to do all these.

**Will Krasnow**No, I'm sorry these.

**Tangela Mcclam**No, can you see it?

**Will Krasnow**I cannot see it yet. Did you, oh, there we are. I got it. Perfect. Okay. So here's what I'm going to recommend you do.Do you have any low inference notes handy?

**Tangela Mcclam**I do. I just took some yesterday. They did not very, they did not organize it, but I could go in and get some old low inference notes.Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Great.

**Tangela Mcclam**Wait, wait.

**Will Krasnow**So I'm just kidding. Sorry.

**Matt Kelley**Sorry. I was going say, yeah, I'd be interested like, even if you don't organize them, my hunch is like.Swift people can still probably make sense of what you've got. Like I'd love to even try it unorganized for everything.

**Will Krasnow**And what does it mean when you say it's not organized?

**Tangela Mcclam**Like, so like, I don't know if I skipped typing class when I was in middle school, but I cannot type.So I'm like moving quickly, trying to everything. So it's like something may be misspelled, some things may be like I put spaces in, sometimes I put s in front of for the student or teeth in front of the teacher or things like that.

**Will Krasnow**So that's what I mean.

**Tangela Mcclam**they're just the raw notes.

**Will Krasnow**I understand.

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah, I think, yeah, man, that's a great idea.

**Will Krasnow**Let's try it out. Because my hunch is it actually will. find it a good idea. It could kind of understand what you meant, even if it wasn't super important.let me scroll down. I'll do this last teacher.

**Tangela Mcclam**And should I, excuse me, like before? I remove names, the teacher's name, or am I actually putting in the teacher's name?That's cool.

**Will Krasnow**I would, you know what, just for now, yeah, you could just put in the teacher's initials instead. Okay.

**Tangela Mcclam**This tracking plan of mine is, must be saying, we're off today. I'm not working. Let's see. Okay, now let me go a bit.

**Will Krasnow**And click generate report. So, yeah, now it's going to take about a minute. So, just to be clear, and I'm sorry, just keep on here.But like when you said before, like the formatting projectivity, that's what you were referencing, like formatting or reorganizing these low inference notes.

**Tangela Mcclam**Yes.

**Will Krasnow**Understood.

**Tangela Mcclam**Like two of them up so that they like if I accidentally type the name, I'll take the name out, I'll put it in, you know, so that it can understand.Right. Right.

**Will Krasnow**And like, you're, because you're in the class, everything's moving, like you want to capture everything. So you're just typing it down and like, typos are going to happen, like mistakes, whatever.And so now you're like, all right, let me fix that up and then give it to, okay, interesting. that's what takes me so much time.

**Tangela Mcclam**Really? Okay. That takes the bulk of my time. that's what delays feedback. That's, that's fascinating.

**Will Krasnow**Thank you for sharing because what we could do is A, my hope is we will be already pretty good at identifying it.So you don't have to do that step. B, we'll see. And if you're not, that's something we could do further.Bye. my co-founders, my brother, and he's very technically strong, and you know, that would be a fun project for him.like, how come you, yeah, sorry, did you have question? No, yeah, I did have a question.

**Tangela Mcclam**And so I go uploading a PDF as an option. My assistant principal, she likes to take notes by hand.Could she in theory upload those hand upload those hand-written notes?

**Will Krasnow**Oh, awesome.

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay, so all right, it may be better because maybe I could just create a form for myself and then go from there.Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Will Krasnow**So on the left, I would just, we're just doing this in framework. I will change it to the school district?

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah, yeah, So here's the score.

**Will Krasnow**You can click on, so there's the summary.

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**it's a little UI thing. We're still working out there. But you could click on, if you click on any of the like 3A, 3B, like right onto there.Um, did I mean to do that?

**Tangela Mcclam**That's okay. So, um, so, Looking on that changes the score.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, perfect. Yeah, exactly.

**Tangela Mcclam**So yeah, take a look at this summary and let me know if you think it's doing a decent job here.Yeah, I think I also want to go back and look at domain two for this teacher because that's where I was thinking.So let me just see the domain two says. Okay, this. Oh, wait a minute. Did I mess up?

**Will Krasnow**Try reloading your screen.

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay, so let me do Oh, two, two, um.

**Will Krasnow**Huh, that might be something we got to work out.

**Tangela Mcclam**Mm hmm.

**Will Krasnow**Not to be. But you're looking specifically for two A or just to be okay, too. Give me one second just to see.

**Tangela Mcclam**I'm going back and look at my notes really quickly. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**We might be bugged. need to work out. Sorry about that.

**Tangela Mcclam**is escaping my mind right now, which, um. We're seeing procedures comes in under, um, two C. All right. I'm going to go to two C.Perfect. Here we go.

**Will Krasnow**I'm just going to watch this one, huh?

**Tangela Mcclam**So yeah, I don't know. Yeah, see, I, I'm. maybe my notes are off but the issue was the biggest issue for me in this collection was her ability to pay inside materials like they wasted about I don't know nine minutes on past now papers and pencils and other things so let me say positive instruction I don't where to go pair the elevator classroom management and student engagement so say I take a little bit of an objective yeah let me see am I let me just make sure I'm looking at the right one we'll see as our procedures I'm pretty sure is is yeah I think that this the bigThis issue for this teacher is in to see just her routines and procedures off the test. I'm worried that that's I mean that's that's something else, but I guess her ability to organize test like distributing materials and managing student requests for pencils to me That was the bigger issue, but I don't know that I necessary like that's probably something I felt as I was in the room But I don't know that my nukes Explicitly named that so I guess that will mean that I probably need to Maybe explicitly state in my notes like you know from One I don't know from I care.remember what the time was. I don't probably like 127 up to 135 Time on past nine pencils and papers, but I mean this makes sense And I like the way it can't occur Yeah, but tell me here like so it does seem like the performance analysis it covers some of it right

**Will Krasnow**Some of the material structures present opportunities exist in hand to optimize my environment for instance teach you say so Let me show you some more and please make sure your name is at the top Indicative basic understanding Pausing to see a clear clear instruction on page instructions providing Interesting so you're you're Just I just want to make sure I get your your perspective Because also your feedback is super helpful because we're gonna make it better from this You're saying it captured some of it.

**Tangela Mcclam**I Think capture all of it. I'm just wondering if it's a reflexes of my notes not so it captured all of it But to me this I don't even know that I believe that it was a basic level of management now It could be that you know my eye is to go in and think like okay What do I have to fix here?So this may force me more to think about okay at least she did give directions she gave those directions What you wasted about seven or eight instruction

**Will Krasnow**All of this sharper pencils get this copy do this and do this so understood so then this I would say is So we have a coming feature that we've been working on actually and it has to do with that additional comment section And I'm gonna explain it you tell me if it's interesting at all What you could do now you can click on the additional comments and type anything out right and it's just like notes for you to hide Right currently just sits there But what we're going to do is that actually will become sort of instructions for the and reorient the summary so you could say Hey Focus on or I didn't think They did a great job Perp or we they spent too long handing out materials Focus on that in your analysis and then it would rewrite To see but only to see not the other ones With that comment in mind and that goes in additional comments, but that's not that's coming up

**Tangela Mcclam**Oh, right.

**Will Krasnow**And I just I want to get would that be useful? Because if it is, we can try and see if we can bump that up on the priority.

**Tangela Mcclam**It would be because that's often what I spend time doing especially when I'm creating plans, right? So I'll say like, you know, I think this plan is great, but I think, you know, it's now I'll say something like, it's now January and we've given this teacher this feedback five times.So how do we accelerate this? Right, right, right, right.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. Okay, cool. Are there any other components that you want to look at? Or for this teacher?

**Tangela Mcclam**You said there is a, yeah, let me say, let me say whatever component I might want to look at for this teacher.You know what I think that this is pretty good. Just look standing its component just because yeah, I don't know if she's ready to have the conversation around like we got to moveon this thing, like I'll be back Friday, and this thing has to happen. And the task, because the task that she was giving the children is in the lesson plan, but it's just that her way of moving about introducing the task and getting things going is wasting a lot of instructional time.And the other part that I probably will add in the additional comments is this is teacher that calls a lot for behavior concerns.Well, in my mind, the reason why you have such behavior concerns is because you have such a long leg, eight minutes of tangible sitting there waiting to get a pencil on a piece of paper before we actually do something.Right, understood.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, amazing. let's do this then. Can you put X out of the screen? And I'm going to have you actually save this evaluation, and we're going to turn it into a coaching plan.Click close, yeah. then click, log in in the top right. And click, click, sign up on the bottom. And create an account here, and what this is going to enable you to do is actually save this evaluation, and then use that saved evaluation and all formerly saved evaluation, which in this case is just one, to generate a coaching plan.And I'm curious if you'll find that coaching plan useful.

**Tangela Mcclam**So, I'll put this whole name right now. Sure. Yeah.

**Will Krasnow**So now click the pencil in the middle there. Oh, actually can you click the back button? was my mistake.I told you to do that.

**Tangela Mcclam**The browser back button?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, the browser back button. Scroll to bottom. It should be way to save. Click new evaluation. Actually, and I think what we have to do is now because you just created the account, we're going to have to do a different set of low inference notes.could we try one of your more organized versions of low inference notes, like an old one?

**Tangela Mcclam**And I'm curious to see if it fares any better or if it's the same, yeah, I'm Okay. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**Okay.

**Tangela Mcclam**Can I just take this column? It's really driving me 20. me see. All right. Allow me to put pictures in there as well.

**Will Krasnow**What kind of pictures of the assignment?

**Tangela Mcclam**It was like a picture of whatever the teacher had on the board. Okay. Back here. I wear what page was I on?All right, I may have to reopen. I don't know what page I was in my life. So many fans.Let me say, me try. I may have to Copy the loops again, just because I lost the page. What was what's the site again?right, eval by swift score dot com that it came up. I just didn't want to have to copy it and then copy the The notes again.All right, let's see And let me go to share my screen. Oh, this truck there was going to drive me crazy Now I know what external and external mouseOkay, here we go, present the mail, there we go, share, all right, here we go, make sure. Okay, so the picture didn't come through, so that's fine.Okay, so generate report. Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Now, while it's generating, I'm curious, in that other format, right, or for the previous evaluation, right, was that, did you find the feedback and results useful?did that make you be like, I want to use the platform?

**Tangela Mcclam**It did, because even like, I felt like I was calibrated a little different, everything was bucketed, so I can go in and edit and say like, know, Instructional time was also, however, right, yeah, so I do think that it was okay.Got you. you're...

**Will Krasnow**And even just the structure of being able to see the things in the different spots is useful. Yes.

**Tangela Mcclam**Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Super cool. And what I imagine too is, like, I'm wondering, there's a feature here where when upload your low inference notes, like here, and next to, like, upload PDF or something, it says, like, improve my low inference notes.And we ask you a couple of questions.

**Tangela Mcclam**how long?

**Will Krasnow**Great.

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah. Would that be useful?

**Will Krasnow**You're like, how long were you in the classroom? Like, or just a couple of things that thought we're missing and used, and then it goes to the AI.That's a real pain point of yours that I think that's something we could work on. Yeah. All right.

**Tangela Mcclam**Now, let me just go to these notes real quickly because the notes that I just pulled up. Yeah. You got to remember who it was.And this was from, I'm just looking at my notes, right? And you see this screen? Yeah. OK, so I had a template that I would use where I would say like these are the notes.And then these are my thoughts that are like, obviously, I influence.

**Will Krasnow**I put notes like slow start.

**Tangela Mcclam**This is the first 25 minutes, no reading, no reference to the text, cetera, far too many students not engaging.But I did not put that in the program. So I just want to see how we.

**Will Krasnow**How it fares.

**Tangela Mcclam**Well, huh?

**Will Krasnow**So you can close also on the left, turn that into the Philly framework again. You can just go automatic.

**Tangela Mcclam**OK. Hmm. All right. So I'm going to go to, let me bring my myself again, my myself again, of the pacing.Oh, come on. Pacing, creasing, creasing. Is. I guess to see. Material non instructional duties, not the one I'm just looking for the one that I thought.Hit the most activities in the case of student groups and structural material is what I'm trying to be saying 3c.Strong standing of OK. Mm hmm. All right. I want to put a learning goal to teach us at least the learning target that is being addressed.This could be to instead of coming up with record to the point of work, she's saying, you know, I was a about it, you know, more specific part of the guy.Finally, the teacher could incorporate a brief whole group summary. Individual partner, so I think in the notes it does capture.for the spirit of, like this is a pretty good lesson, but students weren't as engaged as they need to be, right?And so a note to saying things like, teacher could be more specific with props for the partner discussion. The teacher can incorporate a brief whole group softly to explicitly link the individual partner work to the overarching lesson objectives, right?So it does get some points around that. And I think if I had the option to go in and say, for additional comments, I would say, I was there from, 802 until, from 802 to 8, looks like from my notes to 827.It was no reference to the text. And then that probably would calibrate it. Understand, understand.

**Will Krasnow**So just to get the straight feedback this time, was on target. Is that what you're saying? Okay. Oh, we have both teachers.I'm going to go with Ms.

**Tangela Mcclam**S. Let's go with Ms.

**Will Krasnow**S. wait, before we click on it, just want you to know, you're going to see all of your teachers on this day.You're going to see their average of their tangents and score. And you're going to see how many evaluations you have in there and their change over time.So the goal for us is like when you're doing PLC planning, or were you trying to identify trends within your building?You can see from a zoomed out perspective, how are my teachers doing? And what's going to happen in that NA box is we're going to show their specific coaching focus you're working on with them.So if you go ahead and click in the NA box, for Ms. S, you could define coaching plan. So I would go ahead, do you know which criteria you'd want to focus on?

**Tangela Mcclam**Yes, 2C4. Yes, 2C4.

**Will Krasnow**So on the left, I would click 2C. there. There you go. And I would create new report right there.So this is going to show the different domains and how they performed. I would pick domain 2 because you're focusing on 2C and then you can pick 2C from there.So this is kind of your build a I'd be interested to see like you see how 2D has the lowest.

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah. wonder if it's capturing the outcome of these four routines and procedures under student behavior.

**Will Krasnow**The outcome. What do you mean by outcome?

**Tangela Mcclam**So like it's probably generating like the managing student behavior is probably being picked up somewhere around like the teacher remains seated in the front of the room most of the time.they were like 26 kids and maybe 12 were following the law. Got you.

**Will Krasnow**Got you.

**Tangela Mcclam**So I'm just wondering, is it okay with you if I just do 2D or something like that? Of of course.Let's try 2D because I'm wondering if it's showing up there. Yeah, that's the whole point of this.

**Will Krasnow**We want to show it to you. So it's like, yeah, you're intuitions like R2C, sure. But then you're like, wait, that one was a one.So let's build a report about that. What we're going to do next is AI is coming up with a couple different specific regions within 2D to focus on.So which one is most exciting for you for this teacher?

**Tangela Mcclam**So I'm going to say establishing proactive routines. Okay.

**Will Krasnow**on that one. And then it's going to go one further.

**Tangela Mcclam**And then how can we improve?

**Will Krasnow**What do you think is the best way to improve establishing proactive routines? And I'm going to do its thing and generate a couple options here.

**Tangela Mcclam**Look at that.

**Will Krasnow**Clarifying material distribution.

**Tangela Mcclam**love it. Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**So click on that one. So now it's going to take about a minute. and maybe little less to pop out a coaching report, click on, where did it go, click on 2D on the left side there, there you go, and you can see the coaching report here.We're working on, again, formatting just, there's a lot of space, but take a look at that.

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay, I see strength, strength 1, strength 2, strength 3, strength 4 discussion, okay, here we go. Yes, to minimize disruptions, yeah, so that's potentially good, absolutely.Yep, we're streamlining the process, we're doing student interruptions and increase on task time. Yup. Fast and more organized and efficient class on action steps, development, implement a clear pre-stated procedures for material distribution, implementation strategies, model procedure practices with the class and provide a positive reinforcement for following it.Absolutely. There are materials in advance, implementing strategy conditions. I'll show you up. Close, clear, daily objectives. Yeah, so this, so it's funny that it hits like all of the things like in my note that says there's no objective posted.So I think it really took it to like the outcome. The outcome of, or not having an objective and taking so long is that the students had low engagement and are not participating in the task.And she has them doing it. She's reading and not following along. So all of those things are coming up here.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. that's a good thing, right? It is a good thing. Incredible. The one other thing I want to show you is if you click view tree.on the top right there. So what you're gonna be able to see for every teacher, now you just have one report in here, click domain, this was three, right?Or no two, domain two, there. So you're gonna be able to see, all right, I haven't done two A to B, two C, E for my coaching, but I've started two D and it's currently out of one.But over time, hopefully we can get that to a two, to a three, two, four, and you're gonna be able to map that on this tree.And then you're gonna be able to see, well, okay, now I wanna do domain two A, or I wanna go to domain one, and I'm gonna see the different options there.So this is the page where we wanna make it easy for you, map your teacher's girls, because unlike Chachi BT, where you plug it in, whatever, then it's lost, this is gonna store that and show you, oh, like this is what I was working on with that teacher before.This is how we can get two domain two up, and then ultimately the total score there. that's there as well.If you click New Report on the right side, you go back to creating a new port. And if you click, you know, the the pencil at the top, you'll go right to back to your home page.And and also be able to see for Mrs. S 2D as the coaching book right there in the top, right?And that actually what's happening there is a graph to map the progress of 2D. It's one point because you've done one evaluation.But when the next coaching focus comes around or the the next evaluation will track, actually, yeah, not the coaching cycle.The next evaluation will track how it does for 2D and then be like, oh, it actually went down what the heck happened.Or it went up.

**Tangela Mcclam**Good stuff.

**Will Krasnow**We're making progress. So that's the gist of the coaching suite. Awesome. I definitely can.

**Tangela Mcclam**I love the fact that we start that you push me to start with like my less clean up notes because that's one of my biggest things.I spend so much time like, wait, let me clean it up. Let me do. I'll. lose so much time like I think I'm just fearful that it's not going to be able to read it or I had to clean it up before I put it right into power school so I just love the fact that I can put in um the less clean the messier notes and I'm still able to get this report.

**Will Krasnow**I'm glad I'm glad so that's that's exciting and it seems like the AI is already doing a pretty good job and we're gonna I'm gonna go back to the team and try and think about how we can boost that even more and like I said like a feature it's even like click a button it's like um okay amazing so okay can I ask you some of those those those follow up questions now?

**Tangela Mcclam**Sure can I stop here on my screen now?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah for sure thank you uh so you mentioned about one hour per day to entry with this tool how long do you think it would take you per day to entry?

**Tangela Mcclam**I mean I think it will probably minimally cut it in half.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing What about for creating coaching plans?

**Tangela Mcclam**I think it would still reduce the amount of time just because it's like all in one spot, right? Because I'm like going to two different places.have one that is specific for leaders that are giving feedback that I'm running through for the coaching way. So if I'm all in one spot, I'm going to go.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. Amazing. Okay. After this call, do you anticipate using this tool? I do.

**Tangela Mcclam**Amazing. My AP was texting me about putting in observations. Literally. We go forward through the sessions. She's like, when you have time, give me a call.want to put in those observations. I'm excited to call. like, I couldn't respond because I was getting a tool for us to do about it.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**What percentage of evaluations do you expect to use? this tool for.

**Tangela Mcclam**I would expect to probably use it for all of my evaluations. Amazing. Yeah, because this, I mean, my issue is, like I said, like getting that data, I worry so much, like, is the data clean enough?Is it? I have to clean up? Right? This is going to reduce my I also have to say I'm a Virgo, right?So a Virgo. I'm a recovering perfectionist, right?

**Will Krasnow**let it go.

**Tangela Mcclam**And then just right, right, right.

**Will Krasnow**Now tell me for coaching plans. Is that the same?

**Tangela Mcclam**The coaching plans, I feel like, you know, I don't have that so much anxiety around that just because the coaching plan is based on the feedback that I've already cleaned up.I think the whole big thing is like, I got to clean up the data and then get it in and then do the coaching thing.

**Will Krasnow**Understood. On a scale of one to five, how confident do you feel about coaching now that you have this tool and coaching in broad sense?

**Tangela Mcclam**Yeah, so I think I'm pretty confident around coaching, right? Again, I think. this will increase it maybe like a half to a whole point I just got to prioritize the coaching because you know a lot of things happen in my school of course of course so it's not so much that it's like all right now I'm all those so much more confident it's just have more time potentially to focus absolutely and if I'm gaining time from not having to clean up the notes then actually be facing to do the culture okay I know I'm just giving to you this tool now so this might a funny question but on a scale of one to five how disappointed would you be if the tool was taken away oh very I was thinking actually thinking about that and we were going through this the school district is going through this whole thing like these are the tools we can yeah yeah I'm just gonna use my personal email so yeah there so we had to put a number one to five I would say five I'd be very disappointed okay amazing

**Will Krasnow**I want to tell you how likely would you be to recommend this tool to other people?

**Tangela Mcclam**Ten.

**Will Krasnow**I'm just going to, this is more of a clarification in this call. Did you see value from this tool?Absolutely. And that took you 30 minutes.

**Tangela Mcclam**Yes. Yes. Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**On a scale of one to five, how confident are you that you're coaching now with this tool? We'll improve teacher growth.

**Tangela Mcclam**I'm pretty confident because, like you said, on a scale of one through five, I would say a four, because it really would allow me to, like, I would share with the teacher, like, this is where you are.This is where we're hoping to go. so this is what it means to move here. And these are the things that we need to do.Incredible.

**Will Krasnow**On a scale of one to five, how confident are you that you're coaching will improve student growth? Now. you have this tool.I will say it for.

**Tangela Mcclam**Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, so those are my kind of more formal questions, the only other things I want just to articulate to you is you have the tool, you can use it, it's yours to use, you will after 10 evaluations, it's going to cap you and it's going to say you to pay, you don't need to pay, just message me and I will get you on like a VIP sort of list thing where you don't have to, where I can give you access, you know, through this month.And the goal is, again, like we are a company, so we do need to fund ourselves, but the goal is at the end of the month, rather than having you pay, we're going to work with Matt and actually go to the new hour and see if they were interested in sponsoring the use of this tool so that essentially they could, you know, pay.for your use of it. And of course they're interested in helping you and you know help your school. My question to you is if we were to proceed with that, would you be interested in taking part in like a group of like these 15 schools in Philly, they're all new power, you probably know them all.We would probably meet up briefly once a month, there'd be food, whatever, and we just we might be getting like Penn, GSE, the Graduate School of Education to do research and kind of just be like hey how are you using tool, how can we improve it and just kind of get into the nitty-gritty.Is that something that you'd be open to do? Absolutely.

**Tangela Mcclam**Okay, amazing.

**Will Krasnow**you mentioned some APs. Any interest in getting them on the tool? I'd be happy to also just take their names down and give them access or even hop on a call.and do this similar thing I did with you. Or Jane is a pretty quick study.

**Tangela Mcclam**I just do her information, you can give her access. I'm sure she, I can just walk her through it.Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**So yes, me, her, her info, oh, your next batch of evaluations. Just so I know, I'm going to flag it in my calendar so I can just check in and be ready if you have any questions.And would you anticipate using this tool for evaluations next?

**Tangela Mcclam**So there's a get on the phone with my AP. But we don't Amazing.

**Will Krasnow**Well, so in that case, I'm here. So ask me questions. Again, tool is actively being developed. So we were the feedback spun, and frankly, and useful.keep this in the loop. And I'm sure on one of these calls, get to meet my brother. OK, so thank you.
